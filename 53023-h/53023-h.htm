<h2>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap f13">The</span> Translator has been induced to present “The
History of the Assassins” to the British Public as
much on account of the interest of the subject itself,
as by a desire to introduce to them a portion, certainly
but a small one, of the works of an author so highly
gifted, and of such established reputation, as M. Von
Hammer. Nor will the present volume be deemed
supererogatory, if it be considered that, notwithstanding
the attention which, of late years, has been in this
country so meritoriously devoted to the study of
Oriental history and philology, still, but few and
meagre accounts have been afforded of the extraordinary
association forming the subject of the ensuing
pages, and even those scattered through large and
voluminous works. The Translator deems it unnecessary
to apologize for the notes which he has appended,
believing that their curiosity will plead his excuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span></p>

<p>It may be proper to remark, that the Translator
has thought it advisable to adapt the orthography of
the proper names to the pronunciation of English
readers: in this, he has been for the most part guided
by Sir William Jones’s Persian Grammar, and the
very excellent Turkish one of his late accomplished
and lamented friend, Arthur Lumley Davids; he has
only, therefore, to state, that the vowels are to be pronounced
broad and open, as in Italian, and the consonants
as in English; by this means, the uncouth
appearance of the names, occasioned by endeavouring
to represent the vowels by English diphthongs, is
avoided.</p>

<h2>BOOK I.</h2>

<p class="indent f9"><i>Introduction&mdash;Mohammed, founder of Islamism&mdash;Exhibition of
its doctrines and of its different sects, from one of which
(the Ismailites) the Assassins sprung.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>A</big>lthough</span> the affairs of kingdoms and of nations, like the
revolutions of day and night, are generally repeated in
countless and continued successions, we, nevertheless, in our
survey of the destinies of the human race, encounter single
great and important events, which, fertilizing like springs, or
devastating like volcanoes, interrupt the uniform wilderness of
history. The more flowery the strand,&mdash;the more desolating
the lava,&mdash;the rarer and more worthy objects do they become
to the curiosity of travellers, and the narratives of their
guides. The incredible, which has never been witnessed,
but is nevertheless true, affords the richest materials for
historical composition, providing the sources be authentic
and accessible. Of all events, the account of which, since
history has been written, has descended to us, one of the
most singular and wonderful is the establishment of the
dominion of the Assassins&mdash;that <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</em>, which,
by blind subjection, shook despotism to its foundations; that
union of impostors and dupes which, under the mask of a<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
more austere creed and severer morals, undermined all religion
and morality; that order of murderers, beneath whose daggers
the lords of nations fell; all powerful, because, for the space
of three centuries, they were universally dreaded, until the
den of ruffians fell with the khaliphate, to whom, as the
centre of spiritual and temporal power, it had at the outset
sworn destruction, and by whose ruins it was itself overwhelmed.
The history of this empire of conspirators is
solitary, and without parallel; compared to it, all earlier and
later secret combinations and predatory states are crude
attempts or unsuccessful imitations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the wide space, to the extremest east and
west, over which the name of Assassins (of whose origin more
hereafter) has spread, and that in all the European languages
it has obtained and preserved the same meaning as the word
<em>murderer</em>, little has hitherto been made known, in consecutive
order, or satisfactory representation, of their achievements
and fortunes, of their religious or civil codes. What the
Byzantines, the Crusaders, and Marco Polo related of them,
was long considered a groundless legend, and an oriental
fiction. The narrations of the latter have not been less
doubted and oppugned, than the traditions of Herodotus concerning
the countries and nations of antiquity. The more,
however, the east is opened by the study of languages and
by travel, the greater confirmation do these venerable records
of history and geography receive; and the veracity of the
father of modern travel, like that of the father of ancient
history, only shines with the greater lustre.</p>

<p>Philological and historical, chronological and topographical
researches, instituted by Falconet and Silvestre de
Sacy, Quatremère, and Rousseau; outlines of European and
oriental history, like those of Déguignes and Herbelot; the
very recent history of the Crusades, by Wilken, compiled
from the most ancient documents of the narrating Crusaders,
and cotemporary Arabians; smooth the path of the historian
of the Assassins; which name, neither Withof nor Mariti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
deserve; the former, on account of his gossipping partiality,
and the latter, by reason of his meagreness and obscurity.
Even after Abulfeda’s Arabic, and Mirkhond’s Persian historical
work, of which A. Jourdain has given a valuable
extract on the dynasty of the Ismailites, other oriental sources,
almost unknown, claim the attention of the historian. Among
the Arabic are&mdash;Macrisi’s, large Egyptian Topography, and
Ibn Khaledun’s Political Prolegomena: Hadji Khalfa’s invaluable
Geography and Chronological Tables; the Khaliph’s
Bed of Roses, by Nasmisade; The Two Collectors of Histories
and Narrations, by Mohammed the Secretary, and
Mohammed Elaufi; The Explanation and Selection of Histories,
by Hessarfenn and Mohammed Effendi, among the
Turkish: and among the Persian, The Universal History of
Lari; The Gallery of Pictures of Ghaffari, a master-piece of
historical art and style; The History of Wassaf, the Conqueror
of the World, by Jowaini; The Biographies of the
Poets, by Devletshah; The History of Thaberistan and
Masenderan, by Sahireddin; and, lastly, The Counsels for
Kings, by Jelali of Kain, are the principal.</p>

<p>He, who possesses the advantage of drawing from these
oriental sources, which, for the most part, remain concealed
from the western world, will be astonished at the richness of
the treasures still to be brought to light. There lie open
before him&mdash;the sovereignty of the great monarchies converging
into one point; the power of single dynasties, shooting out
into a thousand rays; the fabulous chronologies of the most
ancient, and the exact annals of the most modern empires;
the period of ignorance anterior to the prophet, and the
days of knowledge that succeeded; the wonders of the
Persians; the feats of the Arabs; the universally ravaging
and desolating spirit of the Mongols; and the political wisdom
of the Ottomans. Amidst such an abundance, the miner’s
strength appears too small, and his life too short, to enable
him to avail himself of all: and moreover, the very excess of
riches renders selection difficult. Which vein is he first to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
open, and from which mass is he first to extract the ore for
the manufacture of historic art? Nowhere in the labyrinthine
treasury of the east will he find a perfect work, but
only rich materials for the construction of his edifice. His
choice is determined by accident or predilection. What is
new and important always finds a sale; and the market is
never glutted with building materials, at a time when architecture
flourishes.</p>

<p>An Arabian proverb says, “The building stone is not left
lying in the road.” If it be indifferent to the historical investigator,
who is eager for knowledge, and to whom sources
are accessible, with what and to what end he begins his
labour, it is by no means so with the conscientious historian,
who only works with pleasure where all known sources are
at his command, and when accuracy may, for the future,
spare him the charge of incompleteness. In this point of
view, the serried ranks of oriental histories are thinned at
once. Where, either in the west or the east, is the library,
which contains the works so necessary to the complete treatment
of the most important oriental epochs,&mdash;works which, as
yet, are known only by their names, and not by their contents?
Who, for example, could precisely and circumstantially describe
the history of the Khalifat, the dominion of the families
Ben Ommia and Abbas, and their capitals, so long as he had
not read the History of Bagdad, by Ibn Khatib, and that of
Damascus, by Ibn Assaker,&mdash;the former in sixty, the latter
in eighty volumes? Who could write the History of Egypt,
if he has not at hand, besides Macrisi, the numerous works
which he consulted?</p>

<p>Still greater difficulties beset the writer of Persian history,
whether it be of the fabulous times of mythology, or of the
middle period, where the stream of the Persian monarchy,
till then restrained in one bed, flows into the numerous
branches of cotemporary dynasties; or of the most modern,
where it has long been lost in the desert of wild anarchy.
More than one generation must pass, ere the literary treasures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of the east will be completed in the libraries of the west,
either by the patronage of princes, or the industry of travellers;
or become more accessible, by a more extended knowledge
of languages, and by translations; and ere thus, the
venerable witnesses of antiquity will be assembled, all of
which it is the first duty of the historian carefully to examine.
An exception to this want of accumulated authorities,
which has hitherto been so sensibly felt in Europe, and which
checks the writer of oriental history in the midst of his career,
is exhibited by that of the Ottomans. Its original sources,
the eldest of which scarcely boast an antiquity of five hundred
years, might (although not without considerable expenditure
both of money and trouble) even now, be all procured, and
moreover, might be completed and corrected from the contemporary
histories of the Byzantines and modern Europeans.</p>

<p>A history is, however, the work of years; and the severity
of the task demands strength, prepared by previous exercise.
In addition to the immense importance of the subject, we
were induced to impose upon ourselves the present work in
preference to others, by the consideration, that being in the
possession of all the before-mentioned original authorities,
touching the History of the Assassins (besides which none
are known in the east), we might deem the examination of
historical witnesses concerning this important epoch, almost
as closed. Their depositions are certainly sparing and meagre;
but the barrenness of the subject in splendid descriptions of
battles, expeditions, commercial enterprise, and monuments,
is compensated by the deeply engrossing interest of the
history of governments and religions. The Assassins are but
a branch of the Ismailites; and these latter, not the Arabs
generally as descendants of Ishmael, the son of Hagar, but
a sect existing in the bosom of Islamism, and so called from
the Imam Ismail, the son of Jafer. In order, therefore, to
understand their doctrinal system, and the origin of their
power, it is necessary to treat, at some length, of Islamism
itself, its founder, and its sects.</p>

<p>In the seventh century of the Christian era, when Nushirvan,
the Just, adorned, with his princely virtues, the imperial
throne of Persia, and the tyrant Phocas stained with his
crimes that of Byzantium;&mdash;in the same year, in which Persia’s
host, for the first time, fled before the Arabian troops of
the insurgent viceroy of Hira, and Abraha, the Christian king
of Abyssinia, the Lord of the Elephants, who had hastened
from Africa, in order to destroy the sacred house of the
Kaaba, was driven back by that scourge of heaven, the
small-pox, which commencing there, has since raged over
the whole of the old continent&mdash;(birds of celestial vengeance,
says the Koran, stoned his army with pebbles, that they fell);
in this year, so important to Arabia, that from it began a new
era&mdash;that of the year of the Elephants,&mdash;in the same night,
when the foundations of the palace of Chosroes at Medain,
which had baffled the attacks of time, or the builders of Bagdad,
were overturned by an earthquake; when, by the operation
of the same agent, lakes were dried up, and the sacred
fire of Persia was extinguished by the ruins of its temple,&mdash;Mohammed
first saw the light of the world, the third part of
which was so soon to submit to his faith. His biography has
been written in many volumes, by the historians of those
nations who believe in him. From thence Maracci,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Gagnier,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
and Sale,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> have derived the accounts which they have given to
Europe. The first is embued with the fanatical zeal of his
church, the second is the most fundamental and complete,
the third the most unprejudiced. Voltaire,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Gibbon,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and
Müller,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> have painted the legislator, conqueror and prophet;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>after them, it is difficult to add anything concerning him.
Hence, in this case, we shall be brief, and shall only state
what is necessary, and what has remained untouched by those
three great historians, or that portion of his tenets which
stands in the nearest connexion with those of the Ismailites,
and by which, in the sequel, they were undermined.</p>

<p>Mohammed, the son of Abdallah, and grandson of Abdolmotaleb,
was descended from a family of the highest rank
among the Arabians, that of Koreish, in whose custody were
the keys of the sacred house of the Kaaba. He felt himself
called to lead back his countrymen, who were sunk in idolatry,
to the knowledge of the only true God, and, as prophet and
legislator, to complete the great work of purifying natural
religion from the dross of superstition; a task which so many
had previously, at different times, attempted. Arabia was
divided among the religions of the Christians, the Jews, and
the Sabæans. To combine these three into one, by the union
of that which flowed from principles common to all, for the
attainment of political liberty and greatness, was the aim of
his life, which had been so long spent in meditation, and only
late in years was roused to active exertion. From his infancy,
his mother, Emina, who was a Jewess, and in early youth,
during a journey in Syria, the Christian monk, Sergius, imbued
him with the religious tenets of Moses and Jesus, and
exhibited, in the full light of its infamy, the idolatrous worship
of the Kaaba, where three hundred idols demanded the adoration
of the people.</p>

<p>The Jews were expecting the Messiah as the Saviour
of Israel, the Christians looked for the advent of the Paraclete,
as their comforter and mediator, when, in his fortieth
year (an age which, in the east, has always been considered
as that of a prophet), Mohammed felt within him
the voice of divine inspiration, enjoining him to read in the
name of the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> the commands of heaven, and by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>promulgation, to prove himself to his people, the prophet
and apostle of God. Nature had formed him a poet and an
enthusiastic orator, by endowing him with an astounding
power of language, a penetrating ardour of imagination, a
dignity of demeanour, commanding the profoundest reverence,
and a captivating suavity of manners. Valour, magnanimity,
and eloquence, qualities prized by every nation, and by none
more than the wild son of the desert, were the three great
magnets which drew to him the hearts of his people, who had
long been wont to do homage to the heroic and munificent,
and more especially to the great poets, whose noble productions
were hung in the Kaaba, written in golden letters,
and as the immediate gifts of heaven, deemed worthy of divine
adoration.</p>

<p>Of all Arabic poetry, the Koran is the master-piece; in
it the lightning of sublimity gleams through the dreary obscurity
of long prosy traditions and ordinances, and the energetic
language rolls like the thunder of heaven, reverberating
from rock to rock, in the echo of the rhyme; or pours on
like the roaring of the wave, in the constant return of similar
sounding words. It stands the glorious pyramid of Arabic
poetry; no poet of this people, either before or since, has
approached its excellence. Lebid, one of the seven great
bards, whose works were called <cite>al-moallakat</cite>, the suspended,
because they hung on the walls of the Kaaba for public admiration,
tore his own down, as unworthy of the honour, the
moment he had read the sublime exordium of the second
sura of the Koran. Hassan, the satirist, who lampooned the
prophet, on which verses of the Koran descended from
heaven, was forced, at the conquest of Mecca, to confess the
irresistible power of his word and his sword; and Kaab, the
son of Soheir, paid him spontaneous homage, in a hymn of
praise, for which the prophet gave him his mantle, which is
still preserved among the precious articles of the Turkish
treasury; and is annually, during the month Ramadan, worshipped
and touched, in the most solemn manner, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Sultan, accompanied by his court and the great officers of
state. Mohammed’s lofty destiny, in changing from poet to
prophet, has induced many later Arabian poets and beaux
esprits to attempt the like; the consequences of which have
either been nugatory, or fraught with their own destruction.
Moseleima, a cotemporary of Mohammed, and, like him,
the poet of nature, nevertheless, soon became dangerous
to him, as the unattainable divinity of the Koran had not yet
received the sanction of ages. Ibn Mokaffaa, the elegant
translator of the Fables of Bidpai, who shut himself up for
whole weeks, to produce a single verse which might bear a
comparison with the lofty passage of the Koran, on the
deluge,&mdash;“Earth, swallow thy waters! Heaven, withhold
thy cataracts!”&mdash;earned by his fruitless labours nothing but
the reputation of a free-thinker; and Motenebbi, whose name
signifies the “prophecying,” gained, indeed, the glory of a
great poet, but never that of a prophet. Thus, for twelve
centuries, the Koran has maintained, undisturbed, the character
of an inimitable and uncreated celestial Scripture, as
the eternal Word of God.</p>

<p>The word of the prophet is the Soonna, that is, the collection
of his orations and oral commands, which, no less
than in the written Koran, by vivid fancy, energy of will,
power of language, and knowledge of mankind, manifest
the genius of the great poet and legislator. The former has
never been estimated in the view we have just taken of it:
the latter will be considered in the sequel.</p>

<p>The creed of Islam (<i>i. e.</i> the most implicit resignation to
the will of God) is,&mdash;There is no God but God, and Mohammed
is his prophet. His whole doctrine consists of only five
articles of faith, and as many duties of external worship.
The dogmas are&mdash;belief in God, his angels, his prophets, the
day of judgment, and predestination. The religious rites
are&mdash;ablution, prayer, fasting, alms, and the pilgrimage to
Mecca. Creed and worship formed a sort of Mosaic of
portions of Christianity, Judaism, and Sabæanism: there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
miracles but those of the creation and of the word, that is, the
verses of the Koran. Mohammed’s journey to heaven, contained
in it, is merely a vision in the style of Ezekiel, of whose throne
bearers, the Alborak (the prophet’s celestial steed with a human
face) is in imitation. The doctrine of the last day, the judgment
of the dead, the balance in which the souls are to be
weighed, the bridge of trial, and the seven hells and eight
paradises, are derived from Persian and Egyptian sources.
The highest rewards of heaven are&mdash;pleasures of sensual enjoyment,
shady lawns, with rills bubbling amidst flowers,
gilded kiosks and vases, soft couches and rich goblets, silver
fountains and handsome youths. Sparkling sherbet and
generous wine from the springs, Kewsser and Selsebil, for the
pious, who, during their lives, have abstained from intoxicating
potations. Black-eyed damsels, ever young, for the
righteous; and, in particular, for him who has earned the
eternal palm of martyrdom in the holy war against the enemies
of the faith. His is the everlasting reward, for “Paradise
is beneath the shadow of the sword,” which the faithful
are to wield against the infidel, till he conforms to Islamism,
or subjects himself to tribute. Even against intestine enemies
of the faith, or of the realm, the execution of justice is
lawful, and homicide is better than rebellion. The Koran
contains much relating to the laws of marriage and inheritance,
and the rights and duties of women, to whom Mohammed
was the first to ensure a civil political existence, which before
him they seem scarcely to have enjoyed among the Arabians.
There is nothing concerning the succession to the administration
of affairs, and with regard to claims to property in
land and sovereignty, thus much only:&mdash;“The rule is of God,
he giveth it to, and taketh it from whomsoever he will. The
earth is God’s, he devises it to whomsoever he will.” By
these general formulæ of the celestial decrees, a fair field was
opened to despots and usurpers: Mohammed’s idea was, that
sovereignty was the right of the strongest, and he once expressly
declared that Omar, who was distinguished by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
great energy of his character, possessed the qualities of a
prophet and khalif. Tradition has, however, handed down to
us no similar expression in favour of the amiable Ali, his
son-in-law. Moreover, it had not escaped him, that in the
constant progress of history there is nothing immutable; that
no human institution can be endued with perpetual duration,
and that the spirit of one generation seldom survives that
which succeeds it. It was in this sense that he said, prophetically,&mdash;“The
khalifate will last only thirty years after my
death.”</p>

<p>It is probable, that had Mohammed destined the succession
(or as the Arabs call it, the khalifate) to his nearest relations,
he would have expressly named his son-in-law, Ali, as khalif.
As, however, he enjoined nothing on this point during his life,&mdash;for
some eulogiums passed on Ali, adduced by the latter’s
party, are vague and doubtful,&mdash;he seems to have committed
the appointment of the most worthy to the selection of the
Moslimin. The first whom they elected emir and imam,
was the first convert to Islamism, Ebubekr Essidik (the True),
and after his short reign, Omar Alfaruk (the Decisive), to
whom they did homage with oath and striking of hands.
Omar’s severity, equally inflexible to himself and others, and
the remarkable force of his character, first impressed on
Islamism and the khalifat, the stamp of fanaticism and despotism,
which was foreign to its first institution. The
spirit of conquest, indeed, was already manifested by Mohammed’s
first enterprises against the Christians in Syria,
against the Jews in Chaibar, and the idolators of Mecca.
Ebubekr followed his footsteps with his victories in Yemen
and Syria; but Omar first erected the triumphal arch of Islamism
and the khalifate, by the capture of Damascus and
Jerusalem, by the overthrow of the ancient Persian throne,
and the sapping of that of Byzantium, from which he tore two
of its strongest foundation-stones, Syria and Egypt. It was
at this epoch, that the blind zeal of the khalif and his generals
ruined the treasures of Greek and Persian wisdom, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
accumulation of ages. It was then that the Alexandrian
library fed the stoves of the baths, and the books of Medain
swelled the flood of the Tigris.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Omar prohibited, under the
severest penalties, the use of gold and silk; and the sea, as
being the great medium of the intercourse of nations by commerce
and exchange of ideas, he interdicted to the Moslimin.
Thus, by the vigour of his spiritual and temporal administration,
did he hold his conquests, and preserve the doctrines of
Islamism; zealously watching lest their integrity should be
endangered by foreign influence, or the manners of the victors
corrupted by the luxury of the vanquished. It was not unjustly
that he dreaded the effect which the superiority in civilization
and institutions of the Greeks and Persians, might
exert on the Arabs: Mohammed, indeed, had already warned
his story-loving people against the traditions and fabulous
legends of the latter.</p>

<p>The reins of dominion, which Omar had held in so tight
a grasp, escaped from the hands of his successor, Osman.
He was the first khalif, who fell beneath the dagger of conspiracy
and rebellion; and Ali, Mohammed’s son-in-law,
mounted the throne, which was stained with the blood of his
predecessor, and which soon after was dyed with his own.
Many refused to acknowledge or swear fealty to him, as
Prince of the Faithful; they were called Motasali, that is,
the <em>Separatists</em>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> and formed one of the first and largest sects
of Islamism: at their head was Moawia, of the family of Ommia,
whose father, Ebusofian, had been one of the most
powerful opponents of the prophet. He suspended the blood-stained
clothes of Osman on the pulpit of the great mosque
of Damascus, to inflame Syria with vengeance against Ali.
But the ambition of Moawia was less effectual in securing his
destruction than the hatred of Aishe, which even during the
life-time of Mohammed, and Ebubekr, her father, she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>vowed against him. When in the sixth year of the hegira,
during the prophet’s expedition against the tribe of Mostalak,
Aishe the Chaste, having wandered from the line of march
with Sofwan, the son of Moattal, had given rise to certain
calumnies: Ali was one of the many, who, by their doubts
and conjectures, rendered the title of Chaste so problematical,
that it was necessary to have a Sura descend from
heaven, to hush report, and rescue the honour of Aishe and
the prophet. Henceforward, by the authority of the sacred
scripture of Islamism, she passed for a model of immaculate
purity. Eighty calumniators fell immediately beneath the
sword of justice; but Ali was destined, at a later period, to
atone for his incautious scepticism, with his throne and his
life. Aishe led her two generals, Talha and Sobeir, against
him, and by her presence, inflamed them to the combat in
which they perished. A part of his troops refused to fight,
and declared aloud for the opponents. They were afterwards
called Khavaredj (the Deserters), and afterwards formed a
powerful sect, equally hostile with the Motasali, to the interests
of the family of the prophet; but professing many tenets, differing
again from theirs. At the second battle of Saffain,
Moawia caused the Koran to be carried on the points of lances
in the van of his army.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> After the action near Nèheran, Ali’s
compulsory abdication took place at Dowmetol-Jendel, which
was shortly after succeeded by his assassination. Thus the
khalifat, contrary to the order of hereditary succession, came,
by means of murder and rebellion, into the family of Ommia,
thirty years after Mohammed had prescribed that space of
time as the period of its duration.</p>

<p>Of all the passions which have ever called into action the
tongue, the pen, or the sword, which have overturned the
throne, and shaken the altar to its base, ambition is the first
and mightiest. It uses crime as a means, virtue as a mask. It
respects nothing sacred, and yet it has recourse to that which
is most beloved, because the most secure, that of all held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>most sacred by man,&mdash;religion. Hence the history of religion
is never more tempestuous and sanguinary than when the
tiara, united to the diadem, imparts and receives an increased
power. The union of the supreme temporal and spiritual
rule, which the steady policy of the popes, never to be diverted
from its object, has for centuries in vain sought to achieve, is
a fundamental maxim of Islamism. The khalif, or successor
of the prophet, was not only Emir al Mominin, Commander of
the True Believers, but also Imam al Moslimin, Chief of the
Devout; supreme lord and pontiff, not merely invested with
the standard and the sword, but also the prophet’s staff and
mantle. The Moslim world could yield obedience to but one
lawful khalif, as Christendom to but one pope. But as three
popes have often pretended to the triple crown, so have three
khalifs laid claim to the supreme rule of three portions of the
earth. After the family of Ommia had lost the throne of Damascus,
it still maintained the khalifat in Spain, as did the
family of Abbas, on the banks of the Tigris, and that of Fatima,
on those of the Nile. As formerly, the Ommiades, the Abbasides,
and the Fatimites reigned contemporaneously at
Granada, Bagdad, and Cairo; so, at the present day, the
sovereigns of the families of Katschar and Osman possess
the dignity of khalif at Teheran and Constantinople; the latter
with the most justice, since, after the conquest of Egypt by
Selim the First, the insignia, which were preserved at Cairo,
the banner, the sword, and the mantle of the prophet, together
with the two holy cities, Mecca, his birth-place, and Medina,
his burial-place, augmented their treasury and their dominions.
They designate themselves guardians and servants of
the two holy cities, Padishah and Shah (<i>i. e.</i> emperor and
king); Sultan Alberrein and Khakan Albahrein, rulers and
lords of two parts of the globe and two seas. They might,
with great justice, entitle themselves sovereigns of three holy
cities, rulers of three portions of the globe, and lords of three
seas; because Jerusalem, as well as Mecca and Medina, is in
their possession; because their dominion extends into Europe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Asia and Africa; and because the Red, as well as the Black
and the White Seas, lie within the compass of their sway.</p>

<p>Having bestowed this rapid glance on the modern dominions
of the Moslimin, which the illustration of the subject
justified, we shall now revert our attention to its primitive
condition. The first and greatest schisms in Islamism proceeded
from the contest for temporal rule, and the faith shared
the dismemberment of the empire. We have already remarked
the existence of the two great political and religious factions,
the Motasali and Khavaredj, the apostates and the deserters,
many of whose tenets differed materially from those inculcated
by the ruling doctrine; but particularly that opinion
which they maintained with arms, in respect to the right to
the dignity of khalif and imam. This is the origin of most
of the sects of Islamism, and is the fertile root from which
has grown the many-branched stem of heresy.</p>

<p>No less than seventy-two sects are counted, according
to a tradition of Mohammed, who is said to have foretold
that his people would divide into seventy-three branches, of
which one only is the true one, all the rest being erroneous.
A very instructive sub-division and enumeration of them is
found in Sheheristani and also Macrisi, to which Silvestre de
Sacy first directed public attention, in a treatise read by him
to the Institute of France. We shall be satisfied with considering
merely the two stems into which the tree of Islamism,
as soon as it rose above the ground, bifurcated, and which
even now, after the growth of twelve hundred years, still
remain the two principal limbs which have given birth to the
confused sectarian ramifications. These two divisions are
the doctrines of the Soonnites and the Shiites, which, though
otherwise multifarious, differ from each other principally in
this,&mdash;that the former recognise, as legitimate, the succession
of the four first khalifs, the latter only acknowledge the rights
of Ali and his descendants. The Soonnite is shocked by the
murder of Osman, and the Shiite is revolted by the slaughter
of Ali and his sons. What the one execrates, the other defends;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
and what the latter receives, the former rejects. This
exactly diametrical opposition of most of their dogmas became
only the more decisive by the lapse of time, and the
separation of political interests of the nations which subscribe
to them. Most of the wars between the Turks and Persians,
the former Soonnites, and the latter Shiites, have always been
as much religious as inter-national wars: and the efforts, so
often repeated, and last essayed by Shah Nadir, of bringing
about a coalition of the two parties, remained as fruitless as
the endeavours, century after century, to unite the Western
and Eastern Christian churches, with whose schism that of
the Soonnites and the Shiites may not inaptly be compared.</p>

<p>The Soonnites, whose doctrine is considered among us the
orthodox one,&mdash;all the delineations of the Islamitic system,
hitherto published in Europe, having been derived from
Soonnitic authorities,&mdash;are again divided into four classes;
these differ from each other in some non-essential points of
ritual ceremony: as, for example, the ritual of the Roman
Catholic church, and the no less canonical ones of the united
Greek, Armenian, and Syrian churches. In essential dogmas,
however, they agree. These four thoroughly orthodox sects
of the Soonnites, are named after the four great imams, Malek,
Shaffi, Hanbali, and Abu Hanife, who, like fathers of the
church, stand at their head. Their doctrine and that of the
latter, in particular, which is acknowledged as the predominant
one in the Ottoman empire, are sufficiently known by
the admirable exposition of them by Mouradya d’Ohsson.
We are less acquainted with the sects of the Shiites, who are
divided into several, as for example, the Anti-Catholics into
Protestant, Reformed, Anabaptists, Quakers, &amp;c. The four
principal are the Kaissaniye, Seidiye, Ghullat, and Imamie.
We shall here give some particular account of these from Ibn
Khaledun and Lary, both by reason of the novelty of subject,
and the relation it bears to the present history. The chief
ground of their difference consists in the proofs on which they
rest the pretensions of Ali, and the order of succession in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
which the imamat, or right to the supreme pontificate of Islamism
in his family, has been inherited by his descendants.</p>

<p>I.&mdash;The Kaissaniye, so named after one of Ali’s freedmen,
maintain that the succession did not pass, as most of the
other Shiites believe, to his sons, Hassan and Hossein, but to
their brother, Mohammed-Ben-Hanife. They are divided
into several branches, two of which it is proper to mention:
1st. The Wakifye (<i>i. e.</i> the standing), according to whom the
Imamat has remained in the person of Mohammed, and has
never been transferred; he never having died, but being said
to have appeared since on earth, under other names. Of
this opinion were the two Arabian poets, Kossir and Seid
Homairi. 2ndly. The Hashemiye, according to whom the
imamat descended from Mohammed-Ben-Hanife to his son,
Abu Hashem, who bequeathed it to Mohammed of the family
of Abbas, who left it to his son, Ibrahim, who was succeeded
by his brother, Abdallah Seffah, the founder of the dynasty.
The object of the Hashemiye was evidently to strengthen
the claims of the Abbasides to the throne of the khalifat, to
which one of the principal doctors and preachers of this sect,
Abomoslem, essentially contributed.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;The second<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> principal sect of the Shiites, the Seidiye,
affirm that the imamat descended from Ali to Hassan, and
Hossein; from the latter, to his son, Ali Seinolabidin; and
from this last to his son, Seid: whereas most of the other
Shiites consider, after Seinolabidin, his son, Mohammed
Bakir, Seid’s brother, as the legitimate imam. Besides this
order of succession, the Seidiye differ from the Imamie
in two essential points:&mdash;1st. In recognizing him only as
the true imam, who possesses&mdash;in addition to piety&mdash;liberality,
bravery, knowledge, and other princely virtues;
while the Imamie are satisfied with the mere practice of
religious duties, as prayers, fastings, and almsgiving. 2nd. In
acknowledging, as legitimate, according to an expression of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Seid, the khalifate of Ebubekr, Omar and Osman, who are
rejected by the other Shiites as illegitimate, and execrated by
the Imamie. This exception has obtained the Seidiye the
by-name Rewafis (<i>i. e.</i> Dissenters). The Seidiye are again
divided into different branches, according as they make the
imamat descend from Seid to one or the other. They have
given origin to many competitors for the throne, both in the
east and in the west. Such was Edris, the son of Edris
Mohammed’s brother.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> It was to this last, usually known
by the name Nefs-sekiye (<i>i. e.</i> the pure soul), that Seid’s son,
Yahya, who was hanged in Khorassan, is said to have ceded his
pretensions to the imamat, of which the before-named Edris
availed himself to found the dynasty of the Edrissides, in his
newly-built city of Fez. According to others, Mohammed,
the son of Abdallah, also called the pure soul, and Mehdi,
surrendered the imamat to his brother Ibrahim; and this
latter to his nearest relation, Issa. These three, who raised
their claims to the khalifat during the reign of Manssur,
expiated them in imprisonment or with death. By their
removal, the family of Abbas was established on the throne,
till, at a later period, it was assailed by a descendant of Issa,
with the aid of the Africans from Zanguebar (Sinji), who at
that period overran Asia. In Dilem, also, a certain Nassir
Atrush invited the people to recognise the claims to the
khalifat of Hassan Ben Ali, a son of Omar, brother of Seinolabidin,
uncle of Seid; and hence arose the power of Hassan
in Taberistan. Thus the Seidiye promulgated their doctrine
respecting the succession of the imamat, both in Africa and
Asia, at the expense of the existing khalifat of the Abbassides.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>III.&mdash;The Ghullat, the Exaggerating. This title, which is
common to several sects, indicates the exaggeration and extravagance
of their doctrines, which far exceed the bounds of
reason, and in which traces of the metaphysics of the Gnostics
and of Indian mysticism cannot be overlooked They re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>cognise
but one imam, as the Jews admit but one Messiah;
and attribute to Ali divine qualities, as the Christians do to
Jesus. Some distinguish in him two natures,&mdash;the human and
the divine: others acknowledge only the latter. Others
are of opinion that the imams alone are gifted with metempsychosis;
so that the same perfect nature of Ali has descended,
and will to the end of the world descend, to his
successors in the imamat in their respective turns. According
to others, this series was interrupted by Mohammed Bakir,
the son of Seinolabidin, and brother of Seid; who is believed
by some to be still alive, wandering on earth, although
concealed, like Khiser, the guardian of the spring of life.
Others again affirm, that this is true only of Ali, who sits
immortally enthroned in clouds, from whence his voice is
heard in the thunder, and the brandished scourge of his
wrath is viewed in the lightning’s flash.</p>

<p>These sects of the Ghullat are held to be damnable
heretics, not merely by the Soonnites, but also by the rest
of the Shiites, as the Arians and Nestorians were so estimated,
not by the Roman catholics only, but also by the Byzantine
Jacobites. They received the general name of Mulhad, or
“impious.” The basis of their doctrine lies in their extravagant
homage and <em>de facto</em> deification of the first imams;
who, however, far from admitting it, condemned its supporters.
Ali himself doomed some to the flames; Mohammed-Ben-Hanife
rejected with horror the faith of Muchtar,
who ascribed god-like properties to him;&mdash;and the Imam
Jafer excommunicated all who hazarded the same tenet concerning
himself. This, however, did not prevent its gaining
both teachers and disciples.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to perceive its tendency, nor how convenient
an instrument of sedition and usurpation it must have
been found in the hands of skilful impostors or political competitors
for the throne. It was easy to turn, in the name of
one invisible and perfect imam, the obedience of the people
from the visible and imperfect prince, or by the ascription to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
an ambitious usurper of the transmigration of the souls, and
the perfections of preceding imams, to achieve his investment
with the sovereignty.</p>

<p>IV.&mdash;The Ghullat, however, notwithstanding the extravagance
of their doctrines of deification and metempsychosis,
were, on the whole, far from being so dangerous to the throne
as the Imamie; who, indeed, adopted from them the idea of a
vanished imam, but who otherwise maintained a continued
series of revealed imams prior to him, but posteriorly a
natural descent of concealed ones. While some closed the
series of the revealed with the twelfth, and others with the
seventh, none expected, from his reigning successors, the
most requisite princely qualities as the Seidiye did, but
merely devotion and innocence. By means of this doctrine,
wily and courageous intriguers were enabled to keep their
weak princes in leading strings, and by their skilful manœuvres
to delude the people, to serve their own ends.</p>

<p>The Imamie are divided into two classes&mdash;the Esnaashrie,
or the <em>twelvers</em>, so named because they make the series of
revealed imams end with Mohammed-Ben-Hassan-Askeri,
who was the twelfth. Of him, they believe that he disappeared
in a grotto near Hella, and that he remains there
invisible, to re-appear at the end of the world, under the
name of Mohdi, <em>the leader</em>. The second class is the Sebiin,
the <em>seveners</em>, who only reckon seven imams, in the following
order: 1st. Ali; 2nd. Hassan; 3rd. Hossein; 4th. Ali Seinolabidin
(<i>i. e.</i> ornament of the devout); 5th. Mohammed Bakir
(<i>i. e.</i> the dealer in secrets); 6th. Jafer Sadik (<i>i. e.</i> the just);
and, 7th. His son, Ismail. The latter, who died before his father,
is deemed by them the last imam, and from him they are
called Ismailites, as the twelvers were named Imamites. The
discrepancy between them commences at the seventh imam;
as the Imamites (the twelvers) deduce the imamat from
Mussa Kassim, the son of Jafer and brother of Ismail, in the
following order: 7th. Mussa Kassim; 8th. Ali Risa; 9th.
Mohammed Taki; 10th. Hadi; 11th. Hassan; 12th. Askeri,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
and his son, Mohammed Mehdi. The claims of these imams
to the khalifat were so powerful and well recognised, under
the first Abbassides, that Maimun publicly named Ali Risa,
the eighth of them, as his successor, to the great dissatisfaction
of the whole family of Abbas; who would certainly have
endeavoured to prevent the execution of this law of inheritance,
had not the death of Ali proceeded that of Maimun.</p>

<p>In maintaining their sovereignty, the <em>Seveners</em> or Ismailites,
were more fortunate than the other sect. Their power
first originated with the dynasty of the Fatimites, on the
coast and in the interior of Africa, at Mahadia, and Cairo;
and, one hundred and fifty years afterwards, in Asia, by the
dominion of the Assassins, in the mountainous parts of Irak,
and the coasts of Syria. By the oriental historians, the
African Ismailites are termed the western, the Asiatic the
eastern Ismailites.</p>

<p>Ere we commence our proposed subject, the history of
the latter, it is of primary importance to say a few words,
in circumstantial detail of the former, as being their original
stock. Their founder was Obeidollah, who came forward
as the son of Mohammed Habib, the son of Jafer Mossadik,
the son of Mohammed, the son of Ismail, as, in fact, the
fourth in descent from the seventh imam. Ismail, in the
opinion of the Ismailites, was the last of the revealed
imams; and his son, grandson, and great-grandson, Mohammed,
Jafer Mossadik, and Mohammed Habib were concealed
imams (Mectum) till Obeidollah, as the first again
revealed, asserted the rights of the family of Ismail to the
khalifat. These rights, however, were long and violently
contested by the Abbassides, whose interest it was to annihilate
together, both the genuineness of their rivals’ genealogy, and
the validity of their pretensions. During the reign of the
Khalif Kadirbillah,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> a secret assemblage of doctors of the
laws was held, in which the most celebrated among them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>Abuhamid Isfraini, Imam Kuduri, Sheikh Samir, Abjurdi,
and others, declared the genuineness of the Fatimites’ genealogy,
and their claims to the throne, to be false and void.
How well founded, if not this decision, at least the fear of
the Abbassides was, appeared fifty years afterwards, when the
Emir Arslan Bessassiri, a general in the service of the
Dilemite Prince Behaeddewlet, originally a Mameluke of the
Fatimites at Cairo, transferred, for a whole year, to Bagdad,
the two royal prerogatives of Islamism,&mdash;the coining of money
and the public prayer, from the name of the Bagdad khalif
Kaim-Biemrillah, to that of the Egyptian sovereign Mostanssur.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>This rivalry, and the necessity of self-defence, caused
the doubts which the Abbassides had cast on the descent
of Obeidollah, the first of the Fatimites, to fall into considerable
suspicion; and they are considered unfounded by great
Arabian historians, such as Macrisi and Ibn Khaledun, as
being the effusion of a factious policy. The great jurist
Kadi Ebubekr Bakilani is of the opposite opinion, which
is supported, as we shall presently see, not only by this sheik’s
authority, but also by other cogent arguments derived from
the esoteric doctrines of the Ismailites. In order to understand
these, on which also those of the Assassins are founded,
it is necessary to take a still wider view of the sects and
parties into which Islamism was divided.</p>

<p>Religious fanaticism is continually accused by history
as the fomenter of those sanguinary wars which have desolated
kingdoms, and convulsed states; nevertheless, religion has
scarcely ever been the end, but merely the instrument, of
ambitious policy and untameable lust of power. Usurpers and
conquerors perverted the beneficent spirit of the founders
of religion, to their own pernicious ends. Religious systems
have never operated so destructively on dynasties and governments,
as in those cases where the insufficient separation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>of the spiritual from the temporal authorities has given the
freest play to the alternation of hierarchy and tyranny. The
nearer the altar is to the throne, the greater is the temptation
to step from the former to the latter, and bind the diadem
round the mitre; the closer the connexion of the political
and ecclesiastical interests, the more numerous and prolific are
the germs of tedious civil and religious wars.</p>

<p>The histories of the ancient Persians and Romans, of the
Egyptians and Greeks, possess almost an immunity, because
religion, being merely considered as popular worship, could
neither weaken nor support pretensions to the supreme authority.
Christianity never deluged kingdoms with blood, until it
was made use of by ambitious popes and princes, contrary to
the original spirit of its institution; as, under Gregory the
Seventh and his successors, the crosier overpowered the
sceptre; or when, to use the words of Gibbon,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> “rebellion, as
it happened in the time of Luther, was occasioned by the abuse
of those benevolent principles of Christianity which inculcate
the natural freedom of mankind.” Entirely different was the
case with Islamism, which, as we have seen, being founded as
much on the sword as the koran, united in the person of the
imam and khalif, both the dignity of pontiff and that of
sovereign. Hence its history presents more numerous and
more murderous wars than that of any other religion; hence,
in almost all the sects, the chief ground of the schism is the
contested succession to the throne; and hence, there is
scarcely one of any importance which has not, at some
period, proved dangerous to the reigning family as a political
faction in the state.</p>

<p>There was none which did not strive to become, in
the strictest sense, predominant, and to seat the princes of
their faith on the throne of Islam. Their missionaries (Dai)
claimed not only the faith, but also the obedience of the
people, and were at once apostles and pretenders. All
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>the heresies, which we have hitherto mentioned, were, in
spirit, essentially usurping sects. Islamism, however, bore
in its bosom others still more prejudicial to its existence;
sects, which trampling under foot all the maxims of faith and
morality, and preaching the overthrow of thrones and altars,
bore as their cognizance, equality and liberty. We have still
to give some details concerning these latter; to which, in
order to distinguish them from the former, to whom they are
entirely opposed, we shall give the name of revolutionary.</p>

<p>The Persian empire, the most ancient and likewise the
best regulated monarchy of the east, was the first to experience,
and had, for the longest period endured, all the horrors
of despotism and anarchy arising from unbounded power
and resisting liberty. As long as the faith of Zoroaster preserved
its primeval purity, and the sacred fire still burned in
the temples, religion could neither afford a shield nor a mask
to rebellion; but when, under the Sassanides, the edifice of
the ancient system was shaken by new opinions and reforms,
the temple and the palace began alike to totter. Innovators
and heretics sprung up, and sedition undermined, at the
same moment, both the altar and the throne.</p>

<p>The sects of Magianism are very little known to us; hence,
the erroneousness of the prevailing opinions concerning the
religion of the Persians. Dualism, or Manicheism, has often
been cited as the original doctrine of Zoroaster. It has been
attempted to combine into one system, opinions in vogue at very
different epochs; hence, the vague and contradictory accounts
not only of the Greeks, but even of Anquetil, and Kleuker,
since the discovery of some books of the Zend; to which
Herder was the first to direct our attention. His conjectures
confirm what Macrisi, probably taking Sheheristani as his guide,
has said respecting the sects of the Magians. He enumerates
several; and 1st. The Keyumerssie, followers of the ancient
doctrine according to Keyumers, called the first man or king;
2nd. The Servaniye, who consider Servan (<i>i. e.</i> eternity) as the
matrix and sole origin of all things; 3rd. The Zerdushtiye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
or disciples of Zerdusht or Zoroaster, the reformer of the
ancient doctrine of Hom; 4th. Sfeneviye the Dualists, properly
so called; 5th. The Maneviye or Manicheans; 6th. The
Farkuniye, a species of Gnostics who admit two principles,
the father and the son, whose discord was mediated by a
third celestial power; 7th. The Masdekiye, the adherents of
Masdek, who declared war against all religion and morality,
and preached universal liberty and equality, the indifference
of human actions, and community of goods and women. As
he gave free rein to all the passions, he gained all their slaves;
not merely the poor and needy,&mdash;that numerous class, having
nothing to lose and all to win,&mdash;but also those who, on the
contrary had all to lose and nothing to win, the grandees, and
King Kobad himself, the father of Nushirvan. This latter
expiated the weakness of his concession by the loss of his
throne, and an incarceration, from which he was released
only by the wisdom and virtue of his vizier, Bisiirjimihr. His
son Nushirvan, however, purified the faith, and exterminated
this scandalous brood with fire and sword, without being able,
as appears from later incidents, entirely to annihilate them.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
For, in the first century of Islamism, the same spirit showed
itself in the liberal doctrines of several heads of sects; till at
last, in the hands of Babek and Karmath, it raised itself over
heaps of carcases and ruins, the terror of the kingdom, and
the abhorrence of mankind.</p>

<p>The Persians, says Macrisi, have ever considered themselves
the freest and most cultivated of nations, and others
as mere ignorant slaves. After the destruction of their empire
by the Arabians, they looked down upon their victors
with contempt and hatred; and sought the ruin of Islamism,
not only by open war, but also by secret doctrines and pernicious
dissensions, which, breaking forth in rebellion, must
have shaken the kingdom to its base. As these opinions
bore the stamp of irreligion and libertinism, those who main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>tained
them were called Sindik<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> (libertines), a word corrupted
from Zend, the living word of Zerdusht. Their first
appearance in Islamism was in the commencement of the
khalifat of the family of Abbas, of whom, the first khalifs
in vain endeavoured to eradicate them with the sword. The
eastern provinces of the ancient Persian empire, whither
the remaining adherents of the ancient dynasty and form of
worship had taken refuge, and whither Ismalism had, as yet,
scarcely penetrated, were the fertile sources of these heresies
so fatal to the imamat and khalifat. Thus, in the reign of the
Khalif Manssur,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> the Rawendi, who maintained the doctrine
of the transmigration of souls, revolted; and twenty years
afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> under the command of Abdol Kahir, the Mohammer
(<i>i. e.</i> the red, or the ass-like), so called, either because
they wore red clothes, or because they were called the true believers
asses (the arabic root Hamara meaning, both, he has been red
and he has been an ass); and in the same year, in Transoxana,
the Sefidjamegan or white-dressed, founded by Hakem Ben
Hashem, called Mokannaa the concealed, from wearing a
golden mask; or Sasendeimah (<i>i. e.</i> the moonshine-maker),
because he, at night, produced a miraculous illumination from
a well at Nakhsheb, which caused the place to appear to be
lighted by the moon. By this juggling he wished to attest
his divine mission, as by a miracle; as Mani had proved the
celestial origin of his, by the divinity of art, namely, with a
book adorned with splendid paintings (Ertengi Mani). Mokannaa
taught that God had assumed the human form since he
had commanded the angels to adore the first man; and that,
since that period, the divine nature had passed from prophet
to prophet, to Abu Moslem, who had founded the glory of
the Abbasides, and descended lastly to himself. He was a
disciple of Abu Moslem, who was acknowledged also by the
Rawendi as their head, and who seems to have been the first
to introduce the doctrine of transmigration into Islamism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>Mokannaa added to the metempsychosis (Tenasukh), the
incarnation of the human and divine nature, a dogma originating
in India, and afterwards adopted, as we have seen
above, by the Ghullat as one of their principal tenets.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>In the reign of Maimun, the seventh Abbasside khalif,
when translations, and the invitation to Bagdad of the literati
of Greece and Persia, had caused the seeds of science, already
planted, to bloom in full luxuriance,&mdash;the spirit of the
Arabian, which was now imbued with the systems of Grecian
philosophy, Persian theology, and Indian mysticism, shook
off, more and more, the narrow trammels of Islamism. The
appellation of Mulhad (atheist), and Sindik (libertine), became
constantly more and more common with their cause, and the
wisest and best informed of the khalif’s court, were thus stigmatized.
In the first year of the third century of the Hegira,
arose a revolutionary sectarian, who, like Masdek, two centuries
and a half before, in Persia, preached the indifference of
actions and community of goods, and menaced the throne of
the khalif with ruin, as his prototype had that of Chosru.
Babek, surnamed Khurremi, either, according to Lari, from the
town Khurrem, his birth-place, or, according to others, from
the gay licentiousness of his doctrines (Khurrem, in Persian,
signifying gay), for a space of twenty years, filled the whole
circuit of the khalif’s dominions with carnage and ruins, until
at length, in the reign of Motassem, he was overthrown,
taken prisoner, and put to death in the khalif’s presence.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Babek, before he delivered his captives to the axe, caused
their wives and daughters to be violated before their eyes;
and it is said, that, in his turn, he received the same treatment
from the commandant of the castle in which he was imprisoned.
When his hands and feet were struck off, by order of the
khalif, he laughed, and smilingly sealed with his blood the
criminal gaiety of his tenets. The number of those who fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>by the sword in twenty years, is estimated by historians to
amount to a million. Nud, one of his ten executioners,
boasted that he alone had butchered twenty thousand men,&mdash;so
terrible and sanguinary was the contest between the
assertors of liberty and equality, and the defenders of the
khalif’s throne and the pulpit of Islamism.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>At this tempestuous and blood-stained epoch, there lived
at Ahwas, in the southern part of Persia, Abdallah, the son
of Maimun-Kaddah, a son of Daissan, the Dualist. By his
father and grandfather, who had introduced Dualism, from the
system of the Magi into that of Islamism, he was educated in
the principles of the ancient empire and faith of the Persians;
and stimulated to deeds, by which, if he could not accomplish
their re-establishment, he might at least achieve the overthrow
of those of the Arabians.</p>

<p>Profoundly versed in all the sciences, and taught by the
study of history and the dire experience of his own day, Abdallah,
the son of Maimun, had sufficient opportunity to perceive
the risk of declaring open war against the established
religion and reigning dynasty, so long as the conscience of the
people, and the military power, stood at their command. He
determined, therefore, by a deeply laid plan, to undermine in
secret, that which he dared not attack openly. His system
was to be enveloped in a veil of mystery, nor was it to appear
in the face of day, until it had succeeded in placing the
sovereignty in the hands of its partisans. It is always extremely
dangerous to endeavour, at once, to eradicate from
the minds of men the deeply imprinted reverence which they
feel for the throne and altars of their fathers. Men can only
by degrees emancipate themselves from their prejudices;
many but imperfectly, and it is but few who can throw them
off entirely. As, however, it was Abdallah’s design to annihilate
not merely the prejudices of positive religion and
authority, but to aim at the very foundation of all, he resolved
to promulgate his doctrines gradually, and divided them into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>seven degrees, after the fashion of the Pythagorean and Indian
philosophers. The last degree inculcated the vanity of all
religion,&mdash;the indifference of actions, which, according to him,
are neither visited with recompense or chastisement, either
now or hereafter. This alone is the path of truth and right,
all the rest imposture and error. He appointed emissaries,
whom he despatched to enlist disciples, and to initiate them,
according to their capacity for libertinism and turbulence, in
some or all of the degrees. The pretensions of the descendants
of Mohammed, the son of Ismail, served him as a political
mask; these his missionaries asserted as partisans, while
they were secretly but the apostles of crime and impiety.
Under these two relations, they and their followers were
sometimes called Ismailites, and sometimes Ibahie, “<em>indifferent.</em>”
Abdallah proceeded from Ahwas to Basra, and thence
to Syria, where he settled at Salemiye: from this place his
son, Ahmed, and Ahmed’s sons, Abulabbas and Mohammed
Sholalaa, and his envoys (Dai), at once emissaries and missionaries,
spread forth his doctrines. The most celebrated of
the latter was Hossein of Ahwas, who, in the country of
Kufa, initiated, amongst others, Ahmed, the son of Eshaas
(called Karmath), in the mysteries of revolt and infidelity, of
which he soon gave an earnest to the world, in torrents of
blood and the smoking ruins of cities.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>He called himself Karmath, from the broken Arabic letters
of this name, and became the leader of the Karmathites,
who, issuing from Lahssa and Bakhrein, like the Wahabees,
nine hundred years afterwards, menaced Islamism with
destruction. His doctrine, in addition to the circumstance of
its forbidding nothing, and declaring every thing allowable
and indifferent, meriting neither reward nor punishment,
undermined more particularly the basis of Mohammedanism,
by declaring that all its commands were allegorical, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>merely a disguise of political precepts and maxims. Moreover,
all was to be referred to the blameless and irreproachable
Imam Maassum, as the model of a prince, whom, although
he had occupied no existing throne, they pretended to seek,
and declared war against bad and good princes, without distinction,
in order that, under the pretext of contending for a
better, they might be able to unravel at once the thickly interwoven
web of religion and government. The injunction of
prayer meant nothing but obedience to the Imam Maassum;
alms, the tithes to be given to him; fasting, the preservation
of the politital secret regarding the imam of the family of
Ismail.</p>

<p>Every thing depended on the interpretation (Terwil),
without which, the whole word of the Koran (Tensil) had
neither meaning nor value. Religion did not consist in
external observances (Sahir), but in the internal feeling
(Bathin). According to the variations of this doctrine,
which, in many points, touches those mentioned above, their
assertors received various names in the different provinces of
the khalifat. In Taberistan, they were called Seveners, from
the seven degrees of the secret doctrines of Abdallah, the
son of Maimun Kadah; in Khorassan, Mohammere (<i>i. e.</i> the
Red), and in Syria, Mobeiyese, the White, from their dress;
in Transoxana, Rawendi and Borkai (<i>i. e.</i> the Veiled), because
Mokannaa covered his face with a golden mask; at Ispahan,
Batheni (<i>i. e.</i> the Esoterics), and also Mutewilin (<i>i. e.</i> the interpreting
Allegorists); at Kufa, Karmathi, or Mobareki; at
Lahssa and Bahrein, Jenabi; in Western Africa, Saidi, from
Karmath, Mobarek, Jenabi, and Said, four of their chiefs.
They named themselves in general Ismaili, from deducing them
pretensions to the khalifat from Ismail, the son of Jafer Sadik.
From their opponents, they all received in common the well
merited appellations of Mulhad (<i>i. e.</i> Atheists), or Sindik
(libertines<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>
<p>The Karmathites differed from the doctrine of Abdallah,
the son of Maimun, in hoisting the standard of revolt, instead
of, according to the secret system, waiting their time tranquilly,
till the throne should be occupied by one of their number,
and openly taking the field against the existing power
of the khalifat. The contest was sanguinary, like that of
Babek twenty years before; but more tedious and dangerous
both to the altar and the throne. Even Khalif Motadhadbillah,
who strengthened, with the iron remedy of the
sword, those nerves of the khalifat, so deplorably enfeebled
since his sixth ancestor, Motewekul, and received in history
the name of the second founder of the Abbassides, Seffahssanni,
the second blood-spiller,&mdash;Abbas being the first,&mdash;was unable,
with all his energy, to extirpate this pernicious brood. The
astrologers, philosophers, soothsayers, and story-tellers, had
entirely lost all the credit which they once possessed at court,
in the reigns of Harun and Maimun:<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> these, however, being
without weapons, or leaders, were in nowise dangerous; while
commanders of military genius and courage, such as Abusaid,
Jenabi, and Abutaher, guided the mailed arm of the Karmathites
against the head and heart of Islamism. Under the
conduct of the latter, the Karmathites took the holy city of
Mecca, as the Wahabees have done in our own days,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>&mdash;so
little novelty do such doctrines and deeds possess in the history
of Mohammedanism. Thirty thousand Moslimin fell in
defence of the sanctity of the Kaaba against its impious assailants,
who set fire to the temple, and carried away to Hadjar
even the black stone said to have fallen from heaven in the
time of Abraham. This stone was an aërolite, and for that
reason, like many others, an object of popular veneration.
It was restored, after a lapse of twenty-two years, when the
Emir of Irak redeemed it at the price of fifty thousand ducats.
The adoration of the Kaaba, which was founded on this stone,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>was not to have the gates of hell prevail against it. For a
whole century, the pernicious doctrines of Karmath raged with
fire and sword in the very bosom of Islamism, until the wide
spread conflagration was extinguished in blood.</p>

<p>The fate of the Karmathites, like that of the followers of
Babek, was a bloody lesson to those initiated into the secret
doctrines of Abdallah, the son of Maimun-Kaddah, not to
propagate them otherwise than covertly until they should be
masters of the throne itself. At length, one of their most
zealous and active partisans, the Dai Abdollah, a pretended
descendant of Mohammed, the son of Ismail, succeeded in
escaping from the dungeons of Sejelmessa, in which he had
been confined by order of the Khalif Motadhad, and seated
himself on the throne in Africa, under the name of Obeidollah
Mehdi.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> This adventurer was the founder of the dynasty
of the Egyptian khalifs, who tracing their descent to Ismail,
son of Jafer Sadik, and from him to Fatima, the prophet’s
daughter, are known by the name of the Fatimites, or eastern
Ismailites. Thus the name, which hitherto had designated a
sect, was applied to a race. Ismailitism, which governed as
a ready tool the founder of the dynasty it had placed on the
throne, was, in Africa, in every sense, the predominant doctrine;
and the khalif throne of Mahadia, the first residence
of these princes, soon threatened that of Bagdad. It was
from that ancient metropolis of the khalifat that proceeded the
allegations against the purity of Obeidollah’s extraction. According
to them, he was anything but a descendant of Mohammed,
the son of Ismail; but was the half-brother, by a
Jewess, of Hossein and Abushelalaa, the two sons of Ahmed,
the son of Abdollah, the son of Maimun-Kaddah. His name
was affirmed to be originally Said, but that after he had been
set at liberty by Abdollah, it was changed to Obeidollah; and
in fact, if it is considered that the doctrine of Abdollah, the son
of Maimun, so utterly subversive of that of Islamism, became,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>on the establishment of the Fatimite sovereignty, the prevalent
one in the court and the government, and that it was first
publicly taught at Mahadia, and, after the conquest of Egypt
under the fourth khalif of this dynasty, at Cairo; that its
chief, under the title of Daial-doat, supreme missionary of the
crown, was, as Kadhiol Kodhat, or supreme judge, invested
with one of the first dignities of the empire, both offices being
frequently united in the same person; the supposition that
the chiefs of this sect, to whom nothing was sacred and all
was permitted, had placed one of their own number on the
throne, acquires very great probability, notwithstanding the
assertions of Macrisi and Ibn Khaledun to the contrary. The
accounts which the former of these two great historians has
preserved, concerning the promulgation of this doctrine, and
the degrees of initiation, which were now increased from
seven to nine, form a very precious and the most ancient
document on the history of the secret societies of the east,
in whose steps those of the west afterwards trod. Their immediate
connexion with the doctrine of the eastern Ismailites,
or Assassins, renders it necessary to give a brief outline of it
here.</p>

<p>Immediately after the establishment of the monarchy of the
Fatimites,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> history mentions similar assemblages, which were
convened twice a week, every Monday and Wednesday, by
the Daial-doat, and were frequented in crowds both by men
and women, who had separate seats. These assemblages
were named Mejalisol-hikmet, or Societies of Wisdom.
The candidates for initiation were dressed in white; the chief
went on those two days to the khalif, and read something to
him, if possible, but in every case received his signature on
the cover of his manuscript. After the lecture, the pupils
kissed his hands, and touched the signature of the khalif reverently
with their foreheads. In the reign of the sixth
Fatimite khalif, Hakem Biemvillah, (the most stupid tyrant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>of which the history of Islamism makes mention, who desired
to receive divine honours, and what is still more absurd, is to
this day worshipped by the Druses as an incarnate god),
these societies, the house in which their meetings were held,
and the institutions for the maintenance of teachers and servants,
were increased on a very large scale: an extensive
building or lodge was erected,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> called Darol-hikmet, or the
House of Wisdom, and richly furnished with books, mathematical
instruments, professors and attendants; access, and
the use of these literary treasures was free to all, and writing
materials were afforded gratis. The khalifs frequently held
learned disputations, at which the professors of this academy
appeared, divided according to their different faculties&mdash;logicians,
mathematicians, jurists, and physicians, were dressed
in their gala costume, khalaa, or their doctoral mantles. The
gowns of the English universities still have the original form
of the Arabic khalaa or kaftan.</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty-seven thousand ducats, raised by
the tenths and eighth of the tenth, was the amount of the annual
revenue of this academy, for the salaries of the professors
and officials, for the provision of the requisites for teaching,
and other objects of public scientific instruction, as well as
of the secret articles of faith: the former comprised all the
branches of human knowledge&mdash;the latter inculcated, in nine
successive degrees, the following principles:<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> The first degree
was the longest and most difficult of all, as it was necessary
to inspire the pupil with the most implicit confidence in
the knowledge of his teacher, and to incline him to take that
most solemn oath, by which he bound himself to the secret
doctrine with blind faith and unconditional obedience. For
this purpose, every possible expedient was adopted to perplex
the mind by the many contradictions of positive religion and
reason, to render the absurdities of the Koran still more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>volved
by the most insidious questions and most subtle
doubts, and to point from the apparent literal signification to
a deeper sense, which was properly the kernel, as the former
was but the husk. The more ardent the curiosity of the
novice, the more resolute was the refusal of the master to
afford the least solution to these difficulties, until he had taken
the most unrestricted oath; on this, he was admitted to the
second degree. This inculcated the recognition of divinely
appointed imams, who were the source of all knowledge. As
soon as the faith in them was well established, the third degree
taught their number, which could not exceed the holy
seven; for, as God had created seven heavens, seven earths,
seven seas, seven planets, seven colours, seven musical sounds,
and seven metals, so had he appointed seven of the most excellent
of his creatures as revealed imams: these were, Ali,
Hassan, Hossein, Ali Seinolabidin, Mohammed Albakir, Jafer
Assadik, and Ismail, his son, as the last and seventh. This
was the great leap or the proper schism from the Imamie,
who, as we have seen, reckoned twelve, and considerably facilitated
the passing into the fourth grade. This taught, that
since the beginning of the world there have been seven divine
lawgivers, or speaking apostles of God, of whom each had always,
by the command of heaven, altered the doctrine of his
predecessor. That each of these had seven coadjutors, who
succeeded each other in the epoch from one speaking lawgiver
to another, but who, as they did not appear manifestly, were
called the Mutes (Samit).</p>

<p>The first of the Mutes was named Sus, the seat as it
were of the ministers of the speaking prophet. These seven
speaking prophets, with their seven seats, were Adam, Noah,
Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, and Ismail, the son
of Jafer, who, as the last, was called Sahibeseman (<i>i. e.</i> the
Lord of time). Their seven assistants were Seth, Shem,
Ishmael, son of Abraham, Aaron, Simeon, Ali, and Mohammed,
son of Ismail. It is evident from this dexterous arrangement,
which gained the Ismailites the name of Seveners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that as they named only the first of the mute divine envoys in
each prophetic period; and since Mohammed, the son of Ismail,
the first of the last prophet’s coadjutors had been dead
only a hundred years, the teachers were at full liberty to present
to those whose progress stopped at this degree, whomsoever
they pleased, as one of the mute prophets of the current
age. The fifth degree must necessarily render the credibility
of the doctrine more manifest to the minds of the learners;
for this reason, it taught that each of the seven mute prophets
had twelve apostles for the extension of the true faith; for the
number twelve is the most excellent after seven: hence the
twelve signs of the zodiac, the twelve months, the twelve
tribes of Israel, the twelve bones of the fingers of each hand,
the thumb excepted, and so on.</p>

<p>After these five degrees, the precepts of Islamism were
examined; and in the sixth it was shown, that all positive
religious legislation must be subordinate to the general and
philosophical. The dogmas of Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras
were adduced as proofs, and laid down as axioms.
This degree was very tedious, and only when the acolyte
was fully penetrated with the wisdom of the philosophers,
was admission granted him to the seventh, where he passed
from philosophy to mysticism. This was the doctrine of
unity, which the Sofis have exhibited in their works. In
the eighth, the positive precepts of religion were again
brought forward, to fall to dust by all that preceded; then
was the pupil perfectly enlightened as to the superfluity of
all prophets and apostles, the non-existence of heaven and
hell, the indifference of all actions, for which there is neither
reward nor punishment either in this world or the next; and
thus was he matured for the ninth and last degree, to become
the blind instrument of all the passions of unbridled thirst of
power. To believe nothing and to dare all, was, in two words,
the sum of this system, which annihilated every principle of
religion and morality, and had no other object than to execute
ambitious designs with suitable ministers, who, daring all and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
honouring nothing, since they consider every thing a cheat and
nothing forbidden, are the best tools of an infernal policy. A
system, which, with no other aim than the gratification of an
insatiable lust of dominion, instead of seeking the highest of
human objects, precipitates itself into the abyss, and mangling
itself, is buried amidst the ruins of thrones and altars, the
horrors of anarchy, the wreck of national happiness, and the
universal execration of mankind.</p>

<h2>BOOK II.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Establishment of the Order of the Assassins, and Reign of the
first Grand Master, Hassan Sabah.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>E</big>gypt</span>, that extraordinary country, so distinguished from
all others by the many wonderful phenomena of nature, has
ever been in history the memorable theatre of extraordinary
exhibitions of the art of governing mankind by wisdom or folly
in the name of heaven or earth. In the remote ages of antiquity
reigned a caste of priests, in whose hands the king was
the servile tool of their power, the lituus (our present bishop’s
crosier) was the real sceptre. Superstition, and the external
worship of statues and pictures, was the religion of the people,
while the secret doctrine of the initiated was concealed under
symbols and hieroglyphics. Their mysteries had a particular
relation to the state of the soul after death; whereas the
popular belief confined its duration to that of its earthly existence.
It was a deeply designed but ill-calculated policy,
which excluded from the doctrine of immortality the multitude
who cleave to the clod, and made it the peculiar prerogative
of a certain number of elect, to whom it was permitted to
soar beyond the limits of the tomb, without at the same time
neglecting the duties and objects of civil life. It was imagined,
that the vulgar could only fulfil them with all their energies,
and to their full extent, when, instead of being actuated
by views extending beyond the grave, they confine to earth
the whole activity and faculty of their mind, during the space
of time which intervenes between the cradle and the coffin.<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
Thus, neither time nor vigour would be lost in vain hopes or
useless speculations; every application of them was devoted
to civil existence: this was the object of the state, which reserved
to itself the allotment of rewards and punishments, not
only here but hereafter. In order to satisfy, in some measure,
that longing after continued existence implanted by nature in
every breast, though deriving little support from reason, the
people sought to preserve their bodies and names for the
longest possible period, by mummies and tombs: hence those
mighty monuments, and the secret judgment of the dead, in
which the priests, as assessors and judges, were the dispensers
of this transitory immortality of stone and dust. To the few
better informed, and who were not satisfied with this mummery,
the judgment of the dead was symbolically explained
in the mysteries, and the real immortality of the soul taught;
and explanations were afforded by the priests of subjects of
which they were themselves entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>Moses, imbued with the Egyptian policy, and initiated
into the mysteries of the sacerdotal colleges, among many
other of their institutions, retained this, of not imparting to his
people the doctrine of immortality, which, in all probability,
remained, as in Egypt, the peculiar privilege of the priestly
order. We find no trace of it in the books of the Hebrews;
except in the Arabic poem of Job, which, in fact, does not
belong to them.</p>

<p>How much this concealment of the doctrine of immortality,
deemed by the priests such a master-piece of policy,
has repressed the spirit of the people, and impeded every
loftier aspiration, is sufficiently made known to us, not only
in the history of their government, but also by their still
remaining monuments, which are so entirely unconsecrated
by the hand of art. The sphinxes and colossal statues, the
temples, and the pyramids, those astounding monuments of
human activity, and of the power of numbers directed to one
end, bear the stamp of greatness, from the extent of their
proportions, but by no means that of beauty in their execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
This latter dwells only in those favoured regions of light, to
which art and religion are together elevated by the idea of
immortality. Although this mysterious policy set bounds to
the more free developement of civilization, and the elevation
of the people to a higher social grade, it is nevertheless very
probable, that it proceeded from purely intellectual views,
and the honest intention of laying the foundation of the
highest prosperity for the kingdom, and the greatest temporal
happiness of the people, by the undisturbed activity of all
human energies, and the continued application of them to one
political object. The secret doctrine benefited the initiated,
while it did not injure the profane. Of an entirely opposite
nature, was, as we have seen, that which prevailed in modern
Egypt, during the middle ages; the former contrived for the
strengthening of the throne and the altar, the latter imagined
for their ruin. As wide a chasm, as that which lies between
the building of ancient Memphis and the founding of modern
Cairo, divides the secret tenets of the academies of Heliopolis
from those of the modern house of science. Egypt, in
remote antiquity the cradle of science and social institutions,
afterwards the mother of alchemy and treasure-hunting, by
means of the philosopher’s stone and talismans,&mdash;became, in
modern times, the native soil of secret sciences and societies.</p>

<p>The lodge of Cairo, whose political aim was, as we have
already seen, to overthrow the khalifat of the family of
Abbas, in favour of the Fatimites, spread its secret doctrine,
by its Dais (<i>i. e.</i> political and religious missionaries). To these
were subordinate the ordinary partisans, Refik, or fellows,
who, initiated into one or several grades of the mysteries,
were, nevertheless, neither to teach them, nor to collect
the suffrages for any dynasty; this being the peculiar privilege
of the Dais, whose chief, the Dail-doat, or grand-master,
resided at Cairo, in the House of Sciences. This institution
remained unchanged, from its foundation by Hakem,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> to the
time of the khalif, Emr-Biahkam-illah,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> when the Emir-ol-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>juyush,
or commander-in-chief of the army Efdhal, on the occasion
of an insurrection fomented by the members of the lodge,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
caused it to be shut up, and, as it appears, to be destroyed.
When, after his death in the following year, the society
strongly urged their re-opening, the vizier, Maimun, refused
to open the academy on the same spot, but permitted them to
erect, in a different situation, another building, dedicated to
the same purpose, which was Darolilm-jedide (<i>i. e.</i> the new
House of Sciences); where public courses of instruction and
secret meetings, as before, continued, till the downfall of the
Fatimite dynasty. The effects of their doctrine soon appeared
in the increasing power of the Fatimites, and the feebleness
into which the khalifat of the family of Abbas gradually sank.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
The Emir Bessassiri, one of the most zealous partisans and
defenders of the former, took possession,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> for a whole year,
at Bagdad, of the two royal prerogatives of Islamism, the
mint and the pulpit, in the name of the Egyptian khalif,
Mostanssur, who would have retained them, had not Bessassiri
fallen in the following year, by the sword of Togrul, who had
hastened to the assistance of the Abbassides. In the meanwhile,
the fellows, Refik, and the masters, Dai, inundated the
whole of Asia; and one of the latter, Hassan-ben-Sabah
Homairi, was the founder of a new branch of the sect, namely,
the eastern Ismailites, or Assassins, before whose cradle we
now stand.</p>

<p>Hassan Sabah, or Hassan-ben-Sabah, that is, one of the
descendants of Sabah, was the son of Ali, a strict Shiite of Rei,
who took his name from Sabah Homairi, and pretended that
his father had gone from Kufa to Kum, and from Kum to Rei.
This allegation met, however, with considerable contradiction
from the natives of Khorassan, particularly those of Tus, who
unanimously asserted that his ancestors had constantly dwelt
in the villages of that province. Ali was universally suspected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>of heretical notions and expressions, which gained him the
reputation of Rafedhi, or Motasal (Dissenter, or Separatist).
He sought, by false confessions and oaths, to prove his orthodoxy
to Abumoslem, the governor of the province, a strict
Soonnite, and afterwards withdrew to a monastery, to lead a
life of contemplation. This retirement, however, had not the
effect of securing him from public report, which at one time
accused him of heresy and heterodoxy, at another, of infidelity
and atheism. In order to clear himself, as much as possible,
from this suspicion, he sent his young son, Hassan, to Nishabur,
and placed him in the school of the illustrious Mowafek
Nishaburi, who, at that time past eighty years of age, not only
enjoyed the well-merited consideration of being the first doctor
of the Soonna, but also the advantageous reputation, which
events justified, of securing the temporal happiness of all who
studied the Koran and Soonna under his auspices. Great was
the concourse of distinguished youths who sought from him
happiness and instruction, and justified, by the developement
of fortunate talents, the established opinion of the Imam’s
wisdom and auspicious conversation. His last pupils, even
to his death, contributed to confirm his reputation:&mdash;three
of them, who flourished at the same time,&mdash;Hassan, Omar
Khiam, and Nisam-ol-mulk, endued with the most splendid
talents, pursued the most different careers, with the most fortunate
results. They shone among the constellations of
mighty minds of their age, like the three stars in Orion’s belt,&mdash;Omar
Khiam, as an astronomer and philosophical poet;
Nisam-ol-mulk, as grand vizier; and Hassan-ben-Sabah, as
the head of a sect and founder of the Assassins. The first,
useless in civil society, was innoxious, by his epicurean
mode of life; the second was a beneficent, active, and learned
statesman, under three of the Seljukide sultans; and the third,
by his diabolical policy, became a pernicious scourge to
humanity.</p>

<p>The ambition of the latter burst forth even in his youth,
when he endeavoured to lay the foundation of his fortune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
with his two school-fellows, by mutual promises. One of
them, the vizier, Nisam-ol-mulk, that is, <em>order of rule</em>, himself
relates, in his character of historian, the obligations into which
they entered, and their sequel. “The general opinion is,”
said Hassan, one day, to the other two, “that the imam’s
pupils are certain of their fortune; now, let us promise each
other, that if this proves true of only one of us three, he will
share his good fortune with the other two.” Omar Khiam
and Nisam-ol-mulk agreed to Hassan’s proposal, with mutual
engagements; the first too indolent to involve himself in
politics, the second too magnanimous not to wish to share
with the restless ambition of the third, that prosperity, which
his great talents and honest industry ensured him in that
career. Years elapsed, during which Nisam-ol-mulk travelled
through the countries of Khorassan, Mawarainehr, Khasnin,
and Kabul, and filled the lower offices of the state, till he at
last attained, under Alparslan, the great prince of the Seljuks,
the highest post in the empire,&mdash;that of vizier. He received
with honour his old school-fellow, Omar Khiam, who was the
first to visit him, and mindful, as he himself relates, of his
youthful promise, offered him his credit and influence, in
procuring him an office; which is the more probable, as
Nisam’s knowledge of the world convinced him that Khiam’s
love for epicurean enjoyments would reject the offer; and
that, in any case, such a rival, as vizier, could never prove
dangerous to him. Omar Khiam thanked him, and merely
requested peaceful leisure to devote himself, undisturbed, to
the pursuit of the sciences; and, as he constantly gave the
same answer to Nisam-ol-mulk’s repeated offers to make him
vizier, the latter granted him an annual pension of one
thousand ducats, out of the revenues of Nishabur, in which
place, removed from the turmoil of public affairs, and in the
bosom of luxurious independence, he henceforward devoted his
life to the cultivation of his genius and the sciences, and gained
great fame as a poet and astronomer. Although his love of
ease did not permit him to transmit his glory to posterity, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
any considerable work, yet he has preserved it in the history
of Persian poetry, merely by his four-line strophes. These
are unique in their kind, by the licentiousness of their overwhelming
wit, which, without the least scruple, indulged itself
in pleasantries, at the expense of all pious persons, and particularly
the mystics, not only on the doctrines of the Sofis,
but also the Koran itself; so much, as to be held by the orthodox
in the worst reputation for impiety. Omar Khiam,
in the collection of his quatrains (Rubayat), and Ibn Yemen,
in that of his fragments (Mokataat), merit, before all Persian
poets who have gained a name, that, more particularly, of
philosophical. The genius of the former is allied to that of
Young, the latter to that of Voltaire.</p>

<p>Hassan Sabah lived in obscurity, and unknown, during the
ten years’ reign of Alparslan. Immediately, however, after
the accession of Melekshah, under whom Nisam-ol-mulk
enjoyed the same unlimited power, as vizier, as he had under
his predecessor,&mdash;the son of Sabah also appeared at the court
of the Sultan of the Seljukides, and with harsh words from
the Koran, directed against promise-breakers, reminded the
vizier of the fulfilment of the obligations of his youth. Nisam-ol-mulk
received him with honour, procured him considerable
titles and revenues, and introduced him to the sultan, of whom
Hassan, by crafty hypocrisy, and under the mask of virtuous
frankness and candid honesty, soon became master. The
sultan consulted him on all important occasions, and acted
according to his decision. The authority and influence of
Nisam-ol-mulk were soon essentially endangered, and Hassan
laboured with zeal to accomplish the fall of his benefactor.
With consummate art, he caused the smallest oversights of
the divan to come to the sultan’s knowledge; and on being
questioned, contrived, by the most insidious representations,
sophisms, and unfavourable impressions, to turn his sovereign’s
mind against the vizier. The most cruel blow of this
kind was, according to Nisam-ol-mulk’s own confession,
Hassan’s pledging himself to lay before the sultan, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
forty days, the balance sheet of the revenues and expenditure
of the state,&mdash;a task, to the execution of which the vizier had
requested a period ten times as long. Melekshah placed at
Hassan’s disposal all the secretaries of the chamber, with
whose assistance he performed the desired computation within
the promised time. Nisam-ol-mulk relates, that, although
Hassan gained the victory, he reaped no advantage from it;
for, after having sent in his accounts, he was compelled to leave
the court with dishonour. He, however, does not give us the
proper cause of his disgrace. According to the statement of
other historians, it is very probable, that Nisam-ol-mulk, consulting
his own preservation, found means to mutilate Hassan’s
estimate, by the abstraction of some leaves; and as no account
could be given by the latter to the sultan, of this unexpected
disorder in his papers, he increased the sovereign’s displeasure,
in order to remove so dangerous a rival for ever from the
court. He declares, very <em>naïvely</em>, in his Political Institutes
(Wassaya), that if this misfortune had not befallen the son of
Sabah, he would himself have been necessitated to adopt the
same course,&mdash;that is, to have abandoned the court and his
office.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>Hassan retired from Melekshah’s court to Rei, and then
to Ispahan, where he kept himself secluded in the house of
Abufasl, in order to escape the inquiries of Nisam-ol-mulk.
He soon gained over the Reis to his opinions, and lived sometime
with him. One day, he concluded the complaints which
he was making against Melekshah and his vizier, with the
expression, that “if he had had at his bidding but two devoted
friends, he would soon have overturned the power of the Turk
and the peasant” (the sultan and the vizier). These remarkable
words unveil the profound and extensive plans of the
founder of the Assassins, who already contemplated the ruin
of kings and ministers. The canon of the whole policy of
this order of murderers is comprised in them. Opinions are
powerless, so long as they only confuse the brain, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>arming the hand. Scepticism and free-thinking, as long as
they occupied only the minds of the indolent and philosophical,
have caused the ruin of no throne, for which purpose religious
and political fanaticism are the strongest levers in the hands of
nations. It is nothing to the ambitious man what people believe,
but it is everything to know how he may turn them, for
the execution of his projects. He is satisfied with finding
ready slaves, faithful satellites, and blind instruments. What
may not two such, animated by the soul of a third, and obeying
his behests, accomplish? This truth, which lay open to
the enterprising soul of Hassan, found no access to the understanding
of his host, the Reis Abufasl, one of the shrewdest and
most intelligent men of his time. He considered these words
as a sign of madness, and doubted not that they were the
effusion of delirium; for, thought he, how could it occur to
a man of sound intellect, to place himself, with two adherents,
in opposition to Melekshah, whose power extended from
Antioch to Kashgar. Without imparting his thoughts to his
guest, he placed before him, at breakfast and dinner, in hopes
of restoring his health, aromatic drinks and dishes, prepared
with saffron, which were considered as strengtheners of the
brain. Hassan guessed his host’s design, and prepared to
leave him. The latter in vain employed all his eloquence to
retain him;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> he soon after repaired to Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>When, twenty years afterwards, Hassan had possessed
himself of the strong fortress of Alamut, and the Vizier Nisam-ol-mulk
had fallen under the daggers of his assassins, and
the Sultan Melekshah had followed him to the grave soon
after,&mdash;the Reis Abufasl was at the castle, as one of the most
zealous of Hassan’s partisans. “Reis,” said the latter to him,
“which of us two was out of his senses, I or thou? and which
would the aromatic drinks, and dishes dressed with saffron,
which thou settedst before me at Ispahan, have best suited,&mdash;thee
or me? Thou seest how I have kept my word, as soon
as I found two trusty friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>The reign of Sultan Melekshah, during the twenty years
of which Hassan Sabah was occupied in laying the foundation
of his power,&mdash;is one of the most stormy periods of middle
oriental history, many ways distinguished by the downfall of
old, and the rise of new, dynasties. In Taberistan, Aleppo,
and Diarbekr, the races of the Beni Siad, Beni Merdas, and
Beni Merwan,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> disappeared, and in their place, the families
of Danishmend-Bawend and Ortok,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> raised themselves to the
thrones of Kum, Taberistan, and Maradin.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The Seljukides,
who, since the time of their founder, Togrul-beg, had ruled
in Iran, spread their branches into Syria,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Karman,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> and Asia
Minor;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Bagdad, the metropolis of the Abbasside khalifs, was
torn with intestine religious wars.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The Soonnites and the
Shiites, the followers of the Imams, Eshaari and Hanbeli,
fought sanguinary combats within the city’s walls.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The
mint, and prayers from the pulpit, had, indeed, since the death
of the Emir Bessassiri,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> been restored to the name of the family
of Abbas; but in both the holy cities of Mecca and Medina,
they were continued in the name of the fanatical khalif, Mostanssur,
who occupied the throne of Egypt. His Dais, or
missionaries, the initiated of the Ismailites, the Apostles of
the lodge of Cairo, inundated the whole of Asia, in order to
gain proselytes to the cause of infidelity and rebellion. It
cannot afford matter of surprise that, in Hassan Sabah, their
seed met with a fertile soil. We will relate the beginning of
his connexion with them, in his own words, as history preserves
them.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>“From my childhood, from my seventh year, my sole
effort has been to extend the bounds of my knowledge and
to increase my capacities. Like my fathers, I was educated
in the tenets of the twelve imams (Imamie), and I formed an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>acquaintance with an Ismailite Refik (Fellow), called Emire
Dharab, with whom I cemented bonds of friendship. My
opinion was, that the doctrine of the Ismailites was like that
of the philosophers, and that the ruler of Egypt was one of
the initiated: whenever, therefore, Emire spoke in favour of
their principles, I disputed with him, and there was a great
deal of discussion between us concerning points of faith. I
did not in the least admit the justice of the reproaches which
Emire lavished on my sect; nevertheless they left a deep impression
on my mind. In the meanwhile he left me, and I
was attacked by a severe fit of illness, during which I blamed
my obstinacy in not having embraced the doctrine of the Ismailites,
which was the true one; and I dreaded lest, should
death await me, from which God preserved me, I might die
without obtaining a knowledge of the truth: at length I recovered,
and met with another Ismailite, Abu-Nedshm-Saraj,
whom I questioned concerning the truth of his doctrine;
Abunedshm explained it to me in the most circumstantial
manner that I came fully to understand it. Lastly, I found
a Dai (Missionary), called Mumin, to whom the Sheikh Abdolmelek-ben-Attash,
the president of the missions of Irak,
had granted permission to exercise that office. I entreated
him to accept my homage in the name of the Fatimite khalif;
this he at first refused, because I was of higher rank than
himself, but as I urged it most pressingly, he at length acquiesced.
Now when the Sheikh Abdolmelek arrived at Rei,
and had become acquainted with my opinions in conversation,
my demeanour pleased him so, that he immediately invested
me with the office of Dai (religious and political missionary).
He said to me, ‘Thou must go to Egypt to enjoy the happiness
of serving the Imam Mostanssur, (the reigning Fatimite
khalif).’ On the Sheikh Abdolmelek’s departure from Rei
on his route to Ispahan, I journeyed into Egypt.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>Hassan then had been already initiated, in Persia, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>Ismailite mysteries of Atheism and immorality, and had even
been deemed worthy to become a teacher and promulgator of
them. The fame of his great talents, and the authority which
he had enjoyed at the court of Melekshah, preceded him; and
the khalif Mostanssur, delighted with the acquisition of such a
partisan, received him with honour and distinction. The
chief of the missionaries, or grand-master of the lodge, Dail
Doat, the Sherif Tahre Kaswimi, and some other persons of
rank and influence, were despatched to the frontiers to meet
him; Mostanssur assigned him a residence in the city, and
welcomed him in the person of his ministers and court dignitaries,
and loaded him with marks of honour and favour.
According to some, Hassan remained eighteen months at
Cairo, during which, although the khalif had no personal interview
with him, he interested himself in every thing that
concerned him, and even spoke of him in terms of the highest
eulogium: so great were the recommendations and predilection
of the khalif, that his relations and chief officers were
persuaded that Hassan would be named prime minister. In
the meantime, clouds of disunion and discord arose between
Hassan and Bedr Jemali (<em>full moon of beauty</em>), the Emirol
Juyush, or commander-in-chief, who enjoyed unlimited power
in the Ismailite dominions. The cause was the great dissensions,
which, at that period, took place relating to the succession
to the Egyptian throne: the khalif had declared his son
Nesar his legitimate successor; while a faction, headed by
Bedr Jemali, asserted that his other son, Mosteali, who eventually
succeeded him, was alone worthy to be so. Hassan
maintained the succession of Nesar, and by that means drew
upon himself the inextinguishable hatred of the general, who
employed every effort against him, and at length persuaded
the reluctant khalif to imprison the son of Sabah in the
castle of Damietta.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>About this period, one of the strongest towers in the city
fell without any visible cause; and the terrified inhabitants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>saw, in this accident, a miracle performed by the fortunate
stars of Hassan and Mostanssur. His enemies, and those who
envied him, conveyed him with their own hands into a ship
which was sailing to Africa; he was scarcely at sea, when a
violent gale lashed up the waves, and filled the whole crew,
except Hassan, with terror; he, calm and raised above all fear,
answered one of his fellow-passengers, who asked him the
cause of such security, “Our Lord (Sidna) has promised me
that no evil shall befal me.” The sea becoming calm some
minutes afterwards, the voyagers were filled with universal
confidence, and from that moment became Hassan’s disciples
and faithful partisans. Thus, to increase his credit, did he
avail himself of accidents and natural occurrences, as if he
possessed the command of both. The coolness with which
he confronted the perils of the swelling sea, gave him, with
the apparent rule of the elements, real authority over the
mind: in the dark night of the dungeon and the storm, he
meditated black projects of ambition and revenge; in the
midst of the crash of the falling tower, and the thunder and
lightning, and billows of the storm, he laid the foundation of
his union of Assassins, for the ruin of thrones, and the wreck
of dynasties.</p>

<p>A wind, contrary to the destination of the ship, but favourable
to Hassan, drove them on the coasts of Syria instead
of towards Africa; Hassan disembarked and proceeded
to Aleppo, where he remained some time; thence he visited
Bagdad, Khusistan, Ispahan, Yezd, and Kerman, everywhere
publishing his doctrine: from Kerman he returned
to Ispahan, where he resided four months, and then made a
second excursion into Khusistan; after staying three months
in this province, he fixed himself for as many years in Damaghan
and the surrounding country: he here made a great
number of proselytes, and sent to Alamut as well as other
fortresses of the place, Dais of captivating eloquence. After
preparing everything here for the future maturity of his plans,
he went to Jorjan, whence he directed his journey towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Dilem; he would not, however, enter the territory of Rei, because
Abu Moslem Rasi, the governor of that district, having
received orders from Nisam-ol-mulk to possess himself of his
person in any way, omitted nothing in execution of these instructions;
Hassan proceeded therefore to Sari, and thence
to Demawend. On his way to Kaswin, he passed through
Dilem,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> and at length arrived at the castle of Alamut, which
became the cradle of his power and greatness. He had already,
some time before, sent to this stronghold one of his
most zealous and skilful Dais, Hossein Kaini, to invite the inhabitants
to swear fealty to the Khalif Mostanssur. The
greater number had already taken the accustomed oath to
him. Ali Mehdi, the commandant, who held it in the name
of Melekshah, with a few others, remained faithful to his
duty, acknowledging no other spiritual supremacy than that
of the khalif of Bagdad, of the family of Abbas; and submitting
to no other temporal prince than the Sultan Melekshah,
of the family of Seljuk. He was a descendant of Ali,
and reckoned among his ancestors Dai Ilalhakk (<i>i. e.</i> the inviter
to truth). Hassan ben Seid Bakeri had built this fortress
two centuries and a half before.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>Alamut (<i>i. e.</i> Vulture’s nest), so called from its impregnable
position, and situated in 50 deg. 30 min. E. longitude,
and 36 deg. N. latitude, is the largest and strongest of
fifty castles which lie scattered about the district of Rudbar,
at the distance of sixty farsangs north of Kaswin. It is
a mountainous country on the confines of Dilem and Irak,
watered by the Shahrud or King’s river; two streams bear
this name, one of which rises in Mount Thalkan, near Kaswin,
the other in Mount Sheer, and flows through the district,
Rudbar of Alamut. Rudbar means river land, and is applied
to another district as well as this northern one, which
is called “of Alamut,” to distinguish it from the southern
Rudbar of Lor, which is situated near Ispahan, and is watered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>by the river of life, Sendrud, as the former is by the King’s
river, Shahrud.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Hassan, who had hitherto sought in vain for some central
point for the foundation of his power, at length took possession
of the castle of Alamut, on the night of Wednesday, the
6th of the month Redsheb, in the four hundred and eighty-third
year after the flight of Mohammed, and the thousand
and ninetieth after the birth of Christ; seven centuries before
the French revolution, whose first movers were the tools
or leaders of secret societies, which, like the Ismailites, then
openly attempted what they had in secret contemplated&mdash;the
overthrow of thrones and altars. Long experience and extensive
knowledge of mankind, profound study of politics and
history, had taught the son of Sabah, that an atheistical and
immoral system was more calculated to accomplish the ruin,
than the establishment of dynasties, and the confusion rather
than the ordering of states; that lawlessness may be the
canon of the ruler, but ought never to be the code of the subject;
that the many are only held together by the few by the
bridle of the law; and that morality and religion are the best
sureties of the obedience of nations and the security of princes.
Initiated into the highest grade of the lodge of Cairo, he
clearly penetrated their plan of boundless ambition, whose
object was nothing less than the destruction of the khalifat
of the Abbassides, and the raising new thrones on their ruins.
He, who had till now acted as Dai or religious nuncio and political
envoy, in the name of the Fatimite khalif, Mostanssur,
formed the resolution of securing power to himself instead of
his superior, and did not apply himself to the destruction of
the works of foreign wisdom and policy, so much as to found
and fortify the edifice of his own,&mdash;since, in the opinion of
the Moslimin, the supreme dominion was always vested in the
person of the imam khalif; and the people were merely divided
as to whether this was legally inherited by the families of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>Ommia, Abbas or Fatima. No other resource was left to an
ambitious chief, who usurped thrones and sovereignty, than to
seek them under the shadow of the khalifat (at that time itself
a shadow), and in the name of the reigning khalif; so had but
lately the family of Seljuk, as others had done before, possessed
themselves of the rule in Asia, in the name of the khalif
of Bagdad. Hassan Sabah, who had been unsuccessful in his
hopes at the court of the Seljukides, and had disagreed both
with the sultan and his vizier, could only come forward for
the khalif of Cairo: in his name, and under the appearance of
the strictest piety, he gained disciples; ostensibly, for the
khalifat of Cairo and religion, but in reality, for himself and
the projects of his lawless ambition.</p>

<p>He obtained possession of Alamut, partly by stratagem
and partly by force; and the artifice by which he succeeded
received a higher confirmation in the eyes of the multitude
by means of the Cabbala, which very luckily found, in
the letters of the word Alamut, the date of the current
year 483. Hassan adopted the same trick against Mehdi,
the commandant of the castle, in the name of the Sultan Melekshah,
which history mentions as having been used at the
foundation of Carthage and other cities. He requested, at the
price of 3000 ducats, as much land as an ox’s hide would
only contain; he split the hide into strips, and with them
surrounded the castle. Mehdi, who had already some time
earlier excluded the Ismailites from the fortress, and then on
an arrangement taking place had re-admitted them, was, on
his not acceding to this purchase, driven out by force, and
withdrew to Damaghan. Previous to his departure, Hassan
gave him a laconic letter or bill of exchange, on the Reis
Mosaffer, commander of the castle of Kirdkuh, in these
words: “Reis Mosaffer, pay Mehdi, the descendant of Ali,
3000 ducats, as the price of the castle of Alamut. Health to
the prophet and his family. God the best ruler sufficeth us.”
Mehdi could not believe that a man like the Reis Mosaffer,
who enjoyed the highest consideration as a lieutenant of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Seljuks, would pay the slightest respect to the bill of an adventurer
like Hassan: he made, therefore, no use of it until
his curiosity was spurred by necessity, when, on presenting it
to the Reis, to his great astonishment, the 3000 ducats were
immediately paid. The Reis, in fact, was one of the earliest
and most faithful followers of Hassan Sabah; the second and
most active was Hossein of Kaini: they taught and acted for
him as missionaries,&mdash;the former in Jebal, the latter in Kuhistan,
both names meaning Highlands, and being the northern
mountainous provinces of Persia. Hassan provided his metropolis
with ramparts and wells; he caused a canal to be
dug, bringing the water from a considerable distance to the
foot of the castle; he made plantations of fruit trees around
the neighbourhood, and encouraged the inhabitants in the
pursuit of agriculture. While he was thus employed in the
fortification and defence of his castle, which commanded the
whole district of Rudbar, promoting cultivation and raising
supplies, his care and attention were still more deeply engaged
with the establishment of his own religious and political
system, namely, the peculiar policy of the Assassins.</p>

<p>A power was to be established, to which laws were to be
given, and the want of treasure and troops, the great arms of
sovereignty, was to be compensated in unusual ways. History
showed, in the sanguinary examples of Babek and Karmath,
who had led hundreds of thousands to the slaughter,
and had fallen themselves the victims of their ambition, how
dangerous it is for infidelity and sedition to dare an open contest
with the constituted faith and government. Hassan’s
own experience taught him, by the slender results which the
Ismailite mission had exhibited in Asia, how useless it was
to attempt to propagate the secret doctrine of the lodge of
Cairo, as long as its superiors had heads, but not hands at their
disposal.</p>

<p>During the two hundred years that the empire of the
Fatimites had been established in Africa, the lodge first
erected at Mahadia, then at Cairo, and the system of secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
missions in favour of the Fatimites, had been organized; they
had indeed succeeded in giving the authority of the Abbassides
a shock, but without being able to extend their own; they had
assumed the two prerogatives of the mint and public prayers
at Bagdad, but could keep possession of them for only a year,
and lost it when Bessassiri succumbed to the arms of Togrul.
Under pretence of enlisting partisans to the successors of Ismail,
they had preached atheism and immorality; and thereby
loosened the religious and moral bonds of civil society, without
troubling themselves about compensation; they had shaken
thrones, without being able to overturn, or to seat themselves
upon them. Nothing of this escaped Hassan’s deep reflections;
and as he had not been successful in the usual routine
of ministerial ambition, in playing a part in the empire of the
Seljukides, he afterwards, as nuncio and envoy, paved the way
to his own power, and planned a system of administration of
his own. “Nothing is true and all is allowed,” was the
ground-work of the secret doctrine: which, however, being
imparted but to few, and concealed under the veil of the most
austere religionism and piety, restrained the mind under the
yoke of blind obedience, by the already adopted rein of the
positive commands of Islamism, the more strictly, the more
temporal submission and devotion were sanctioned, by eternal
rewards and glory.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the Ismailites had only Masters and Fellows;
namely, the Dais or emissaries, who, being initiated into all
the grades of the secret doctrine, enlisted proselytes; and
the Refik, who, gradually intrusted with its principles, formed
the great majority. It was manifest to the practical and
enterprising spirit of Hassan, that, in order to execute great
undertakings with security and energy, a third class would
also be requisite, who, never being admitted to the mystery
of atheism and immorality, which snap the bonds of all
subordination, were but blind and fanatical tools in the hands
of their superiors; that a well organized political body needs
not merely heads but also arms, and that the master re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>quired
not only intelligent and skilful fellows, but also faithful
and active agents: these agents were called Fedavie
(<i>i. e.</i> the self-offering or devoted), the name itself declares their
destination. How they afterwards, in Syria, obtained that of
the Hashishin or Assassins, we shall explain hereafter, when
we speak of the means employed to animate them to blind
obedience and fanatical self-devotion. Being clothed in white,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
like the followers of Mokannaa, three hundred years before, in
Transoxana, and, still earlier, the Christian Neophytes, and, in
our own days, the pages of the sultan, they were termed Mobeyese,
the white, or likewise, Mohammere the red, because
they wore, with their white costume, red turbans, boots, or
girdles, as in our own day do the warriors of the prince of
Lebanon, and at Constantinople the Janissaries and Bostangis
as body guard of the seraglio. Habited in the hues of innocence
and blood, and of pure devotion and murder, armed
with daggers (cultelliferi) which were constantly snatched
forth at the service of the grand-master, they formed his
guard, the executioners of his deadly orders, the sanguinary
tools of the ambition and revenge of this order of Assassins.</p>

<p>The grand master was called Sidna (Sidney) our lord, and
commonly Sheikh al Jebal, the Sheikh, the old man or supreme
master of the mountain; because the order always possessed
themselves of the castles in the mountainous regions,
both in Irak, Kuhistan, and Syria, and the ancient of the
mountains, resided in the mountain fort of Alamut, robed in
white, like the Ancient of days in Daniel.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> He was neither
king nor prince in the usual sense of the word, and never assumed
the title either of Sultan, Melek, or Emir, but merely
that of Sheikh, which to this day the heads of the Arab
tribes and the superiors of the religious order of the sofis
and dervishes bear. His authority could be no kingdom or
principality, but that of a brotherhood or order; European
historians, therefore, fall into a great mistake in confounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>the empire of the Assassins with hereditary dynasties, as in
the form of its institution it was only an order like that of the
knights of St. John, the Teutonic knights, or the Templars&mdash;the
latter of these, besides the grand-master and grand-priors,
and religious nuncios, had also some resemblance to
the Assassins in their spirit of political interference and secret
doctrine. Dressed in white, with the distinctive mark of the
red cross on their mantles, as were the Assassins with red
girdles and caps, the Templars had also secret tenets, which
denied and abjured the sanctity of the cross, as the others
did the commandments of Islamism. The fundamental
maxim of the policy of both was to obtain possession of the
castles and strong places of the adjacent country, and thus
without pecuniary or military means, to maintain an <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium
in imperio</em>, to keep the nations in subjection as dangerous
rivals to princes.</p>

<p>The flat part of a country is always commanded by the
more mountainous, and the latter by the fortresses scattered
through it. To become masters of these by stratagem or
force, and to awe princes either by fraud or fear, and to arm
the murderer’s hand against the enemies of the order, was
the political maxim of the Assassins. Their internal safety
was secured by the strict observance of religious ordinances;
their external, by fortresses and the poniard. From the
proper subjects of the order, or the profane, was only expected
the fulfilment of the duties of Islamism, even of the
most austere, such as refraining from wine and music: from
the devoted satellites was demanded blind subjection and
the faithful use of their daggers. The emissaries, or initiated,
worked with their heads, and led the arms in execution of the
orders of the Sheikh, who, in the centre of his sovereignty,
tranquilly directed, like an animating soul, their hearts and
poniards to the accomplishment of his ambitious projects.</p>

<p>Immediately under him the grand-master, stood the
Dailkebir, grand recruiters or grand-priors, his lieutenants in
the three provinces to which the power of the order extended,
namely, Jebal, Kuhistan, and Syria. Beneath them, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the Dai, or religious nuncios, and political emissaries in ordinary,
as initiated masters. The fellows (Refik) were those
who were advancing to the mastership, through the several
grades of initiation into the secret doctrine. The guards of
the order, the warriors, were the devoted murderers (Fedavie),
and the Lassik (aspirants) seem to have been the novices or
lay brethren. Besides this seven-fold gradation from Sheikh
(grand-master), Dailkebir (grand-prior), Dai (master), Refik
(fellows), Fedavie (agents), Lassik (lay brothers), down to the
profane or the people, there was also another seven-fold
gradation of the spiritual hierarchy, who applied themselves
exclusively to the before-mentioned doctrine of the Ismailis
concerning the seven speaking and seven mute imams, and
belonged more properly to the theoretical frame-work of the
schism, than to the destruction of political powers. According
to this arrangement, there live, in every generation, seven
persons distinguished from each other by their different grades
of rank: 1st. The divinely appointed Imam; 2nd. The proof
Hudshet, designated by him, which the Ismailis called Esas,
(the seat); 3rd. The Sumassa, who received instruction from
the Hudshet, as they did from the Imam; 4th. The Missionaries
(Dai); 5th. Mesuni, (the Freed) who were admitted to
the solemn promise or oath (Ahd); 6th. Mukellebi, the dog-like,
who sought out subjects fit for conversion for the
missionaries, as hounds run down the game for the huntsman;
7th, Mumini, the believers, the people. On comparing
these two divisions, we perceive that, according to the first,
the invisible imam, in whose name the sheikh claimed the
obedience of the people, and in the second, the guard, of
which he made use against the foes of the order, are wanting;
but that, in other respects, the different grades coincide. The
<em>proof</em> was the grand-master; the Sumassa, the grand-prior;
the fellows were the freed; and the dog-like the lay-brethren;
the fourth and seventh, that is the preachers of the faith and
the believers, the cheating missionaries, and the duped people
are the same in both.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<p>We have seen above, that the first founder of secret societies
in the heart of Islamism, Abdollah Maimun, the son of
Kaddah, established seven degrees of his doctrine, for which
reason, as well as their opinions concerning the seven imams,
his disciples obtained the by-name of Seveners. This appellation,
which had been assigned, hitherto, to the western
Ismailites, although they had increased the number of grades
from seven to nine, was, with greater justice, transferred to
their new branch, the eastern Ismailites or Assassins, whose
founder, Hassan, the son of Sabah, not only restored the
grades to their original number, seven, but also sketched out
for the Dais, or missionaries, a particular rule of conduct,
consisting of seven points, which had reference, not so much
to the gradual enlightenment of those who were to be taught,
as to the necessary qualifications of the teachers; and was
the proper rubric of the order.</p>

<p>The introductory rule was called Ashinai-risk (<em>knowledge
of the calling</em>), and comprised the maxims of the knowledge
of mankind, necessary to the selection of subjects suited to
the initiated. Several proverbs, of much vogue among the
Dais, had relation to this; they contained a sense different
from their literal meaning:&mdash;“Sow not in barren soil;”
“Speak not in a house, where there is a lamp;” implied
“Waste not your words on the incapable;” “Venture not
to speak them in the presence of a lawyer;” for it was
equally dangerous to engage with blockheads, as with men
of tried knowledge and probity; because the former misunderstand,
and the latter unmask, the doctrine, and neither
would be available either as teachers or instruments. These
allegorical sentences, and the prudential rules so necessary to
avoid all chance of discovery, remind us of a secret society of
high antiquity, and a celebrated order of modern times;&mdash;in
short, of Pythagoras and the Jesuits. The mysterious adages
of the former, which have come down to us, and whose peculiar
sense is now unintelligible, were probably nothing more
than similar maxims to the initiated in his doctrine; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
political prudence in the selection of subjects fit for the
different designs of a society, reached the highest perfection
in that of Jesus. Thus the Pythagoreans and the Jesuits
have a resemblance to the Assassins. The second rule of
conduct was called Teenis, (<em>gaining confidence</em>), and taught
them to gain over candidates by flattering their inclinations
and passions. As soon as they were won, it was requisite,
in the third place, to involve them, by a thousand doubts and
questions concerning the positive religious commands and
absurdities of the Koran, in a maze of scruples, which were
not to be resolved, and of uncertainty, which was not to be
disentangled.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, followed the oath (Ahd) by which the
acolyte bound himself, in the most solemn manner, to inviolable
silence and submission; that he would impart his
doubts to none but his superior; that he would blindly obey
him and none but him. In the fifth rule, Teddlis, the candidates
were taught how their doctrine and opinions agreed
with those of the greatest men in church and state; this was
done the more to attract and fire them, by the examples of the
great and powerful. The sixth, Tessiss (i. e. <em>confirmation</em>),
merely recapitulated all that had preceded, in order to confirm
and strengthen the learner’s faith. After this followed, in the
seventh place, Teevil (i. e. <em>the allegorical instruction</em>), which
was the conclusion of the course of atheistical instruction.
In Teevil, the allegorical explanation, in opposition to Tensil,
or the literal sense of the divine word, was the principal
essence of the secret doctrine, from which they were named
Bateni, the Esoterics, to distinguish them from the Jaheri, or
followers of the outward worship.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> By means of this crafty
system of exposition and interpretation, which, in our own
days, has often been applied to the Bible, articles of faith and
duties became mere allegories; the external form, merely
contingent; the inner sense alone, essential; the observance,
or non-observance of religious ordinances and moral laws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>equally indifferent; consequently, all was doubtful, and
nothing prohibited. This was the <em>acme</em> of the philosophy of
the Assassins, which was not imparted by the founder to the
majority, but reserved only for a few of the initiated and
principal leaders, while the people were held under the yoke
of the strictest exercise of the precepts of Islamism. His
greatest policy consisted in designing his doctrine of infidelity
and immorality, not for the ruled, but only for the rulers;
in subjecting the tensely-reined and blind obedience of the
former, to the equally blind but unbridled despotic commands
of the second; and thus, he made both serve the aim of his
ambition,&mdash;the former by the renunciation, the latter by the
full gratification of their passions. Study and the sciences
were, therefore, the lot of only a few who were initiated. For
the immediate attainment of their objects, the order was less
in need of heads than arms; and did not employ pens, but
daggers, whose points were everywhere, while their hilts
were in the hand of the grand-master.</p>

<p>No sooner had Hassan Sabah obtained possession of the
castle of Alamut, and before he had provided it with magazines,
than an emir, on whom the sultan had conferred the fief
of the district of Rudbar, cut off all access and supplies. The
inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place, when
Hassan inspired them with new courage, by the assurance that
fortune would favour them there. They remained, and the
castle henceforth received the name of the Abode of Fortune.
The Sultan Melekshah, who had at first viewed the efforts of the
Ismailites with contempt, was at length roused to secure the
internal peace, which was threatened by Hassan’s insurrection.
He commanded the Emir Arslantash (<em>Lion-Rock</em>),<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> to destroy
the son of Sabah, with all his followers. The latter, although
he had only seventy companions, and few provisions, defended
himself courageously, until the deputy Abu Ali, who was
collecting, as Dai, troops and disciples in Kaswin, sent three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>hundred men,&mdash;who, during the night, having formed a
junction with the garrison, and falling upon the besiegers, put
them to flight. Sultan Melekshah, being awakened to serious
consideration by this check, sent Kisil Sarik, one of his most
confidential officers, with troops of Khorassan, against Hossein
Kaini, Hassan Sabah’s Dai, who was spreading the principles
of sedition throughout the provinces of Kuhistan. Hossein
retreated to a castle in the district Muminabad, where he was
not less straitened than Hassan had been in Alamut. The
latter now thought, that the moment was arrived for him to put
into execution a decisive stroke, and long-matured plan of
murder, and to rid himself of his most powerful foes, by the
ready mode of dagger or poison. Nisam-ol-mulk, the vizier of
the Seljukides, great by his wisdom and power, under the
three first sultans of that family, Togrul, Alparslan, and Melekshah,&mdash;he
who, in his early youth, had rivalled Hassan at
the school of the Imam Mosawek, in industry; afterwards, at
the court of Melekshah, in their disputes concerning the
dignity of vizier and the monarch’s favour; and who, last of
all, now openly contended with the lord of Alamut for power
and rule,&mdash;he, the great support of the Seljuk empire, and
the first great enemy of the order of the Ismailites,&mdash;fell, as
the first victim of Hassan’s revenge and ambition, under the
poniards of his Fedavi, or Devoted. His fall, and the death
of Melekshah, not without suspicion of poison, which followed
shortly afterwards, and with which all Asia echoed,&mdash;were the
frightful signals for assassination, which henceforth became
Hassan’s policy, and, like the plague, selected its victims
from all classes of society.</p>

<p>It was a fearful period of murders and reprisals, equally
destructive to the declared foes and friends of the new doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
The former fell under the daggers of the Assassins, the latter
under the sword of the princes, who, now roused to the dangers
with which Hassan Sabah’s sect threatened all thrones, visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>its partisans and adherents with proclamations and condemnation
to death. The first imams and priests issued, voluntarily
or by order, fetwas and judgments, in which the Ismailites were
condemned and anathematized, as the most dangerous enemies
of the throne and the altar, as hardened criminals and lawless
atheists; and which delivered them over to the avenging arm
of justice, either in open war, or as outlaws, as infidels, separatists,
and rebels, whom to slay was a law of Islamism. The
Imam Ghasali, one of the first moralists of Islam, and most
celebrated Persian teachers of ethics, wrote a treatise, peculiarly
directed against the adherents of the esoteric doctrine,
entitled, <cite>On the Folly of the Supporters of the doctrine of
Indifference, that is, the impious (Mulahid), whom may God
condemn</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> In that entitled, <cite>Pearls of the Fetwas</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> a celebrated
collection of legal decisions, the sect of the impious
(Mulahid) of Kuhistan were condemned according to the
ancient sentences of the Imams, Ebi Jussuf and Mohammed,
pronounced against the Karmathites, and their lives and goods
given as free prey to all the Moslemin. In the “<cite>Confluence</cite>”
(Multakath), and the “<cite>treasures of the Fetwas</cite>” (Khasanetol
Fetavi), even the repentance of the Mulhad, or the impious,
is rejected as entirely invalid and impossible, if they have
ever exercised the office of Dai, or missionary; and their
execution commanded as legal, even though they become
converts and wish to abjure their errors; because perjury
itself was one of their maxims, and no recovery could be
expected from libertine atheists. Thus, the minds of both
parties were mutually embittered; governments and the order
were at open war, and heads fell a rich harvest to the assassin’s
dagger and the executioner’s sword.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Those who were of the highest rank were the first to fall:
such were the Emir Borsak, who had been appointed by
Togrul-beg first governor of Bagdad, and Araash Nisami, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>whom Yakut, the uncle of Barkyarok, the reigning Seljukide
sultan, had given his daughter in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> The civil war
between the brothers, Barkyarok and Mohammed,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> concerning
the territories of Irak and Khorassan, facilitated the
execution of Hassan’s ambitious designs; and in the bloody
hotbed of intestine discord, the poisonous plant of murder
and sedition flourished. By degrees, his partisans made
themselves masters of the strongest castles of Irak, and even
of that of Ispahan, called <em>Shah durr</em> (<em>the king’s pearl</em>), built
by Melekshah. That prince, hunting once near this place, in
company with the ambassador of the Roman emperor at
Constantinople, a hound strayed to an inaccessible mountain
plateau, on which the castle was afterwards situated. The
envoy observed, that, in his master’s territories, a place presenting
so many natural advantages of fortification would not
be neglected, and that on the spot a fortress would long ago
have been erected. The sultan availed himself of the ambassador’s
suggestion and the situation, and the castle was
built, which was wrested by the Ismailites out of the hands
of its commander. This gave rise to the saying&mdash;“A fort,
the situation of which a dog pointed out and an infidel advised,
could only bring perdition.”</p>

<p>Besides the <em>king’s pearl</em>, they took also the castles of
Derkul and Khalenjan, near Ispahan, the last, five farsangs
distant from that city; the castle of Wastamkuh, near Abhar;
those of Tambur and Khalowkhan, between Fars and Kuhistan;
those of Damaghan, Firuskuh, and Kirdkuh, in the
province of Komis; and, lastly, in Kuhistan, those of Tabs,
Kain, Toon, and several others in the district of Muminabad.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
Abulfettah, Hassan’s nephew, captured Esdahan, and Kia
Busurgomid took Lamsir, both of them being, together with
Reis Mosaffer, and Hossein Kaini, as Dais, energetic promulgators
of the doctrine, and supporters of the greatness of
Hassan Sabah, whose most intimate friends and confidants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>they were, as Abubekr, Omar, Osman, and Ali, had been those
of the prophet. The acquisition of these fortresses, excepting
those of Alamut and Wastamkuh, which came into the possession
of the Ismailites ten years earlier, happened the year
after the taking of Jerusalem by the Crusaders.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> Christianity
and infidelity, the cross of the pious warriors and the dagger
of the Assassins, at the same time conspired the ruin of
Mohammedanism and its monarchies.</p>

<p>For a long period, the Assassins have only been known to
Europe by the accounts of the Crusaders, and recent historians
have dated their appearance in Syria later than it really
took place. They, however, appeared in Palestine contemporaneously
with the Crusaders; for, already, in the first
year of the twelfth century of the Christian era, Jenaheddevlet,
Prince of Emessa, fell beneath their daggers as he was
hastening to the relief of the castle of the Kurds, Hossnal
a-kurd, which was besieged by the Count St. Gilles. Four
years before,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> he had been attacked, by three Persian assassins,
in his palace, as he was preparing for his devotions. Suspicion,
as the author of this attempt, fell upon Riswan,
Prince of Aleppo, the political opponent of Jenaheddevlet,
and a great friend of the Assassins, who had gained him
over by the agency of one of their emissaries, a physician,
who was also an astrologer, and thus doubly qualified to
deceive himself and others, without having recourse to the false
doctrine of his order. This man died twenty-four days after
this first unsuccessful attempt at murder; but the sanguinary
views of the order were not extinguished with him. His
place was supplied by a Persian goldsmith, one Abutaher
Essaigh, who inflamed the Prince of Aleppo, Riswan, to
deeds of blood. This chieftain, who was constantly at enmity
with the Crusaders,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and his brother, Dokak, Prince of
Damascus, favoured the emigration and colonization of the
Bateni, or Assassins, as their doctrine was agreeable to him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>he being but a bad Moslem, and a free-thinker. He entered
into the closest tie of friendship with them, and forgot, in the
pursuit of his infidelity and short-sighted policy, the interest of
his people and posterity. Sarmin, a strong place, only a day’s
journey south of Aleppo,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> became the residence of Abulfettah,
the nephew of Hassan Sabah, who was his grand-prior in
Syria, as were Hossein Kaini, the Reis Mosaffer, and Busurgomid,
in Kuhistan, Komis, and Irak. A few years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
when the inhabitants of Apamea besought the assistance
of Abutaher Essaigh, the commandant of Sarmin, against
their Egyptian governor, Khalaf; he caused him to be assassinated,
and took possession of the town in the name of
Riswan, Prince of Aleppo, and remained in command of the
citadel.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> He could not, however, resist Tancred, to whom
the town surrendered, and who, contrary to his promise,
carried Abutaher prisoner to Antioch, and only released him
on receiving a ransom. The Arabian historian, Kemaleddin,
for this reason, accused Tancred of forfeiting his word; and,
on the other hand, Albert of Aix, the Christian annalist of
the crusades, blames him for granting so vile a ruffian so much
as his life. His companions, however, whose lives were
secured by no treaty, were delivered up by Tancred to the
vengeance of the sons of Khalaf, and Abulfettah himself
expired under the anguish of the torture.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Soon after this,
Tancred took from the Assassins the strong castle of
Kefrlana.</p>

<p>Abutaher having returned to his protector, Riswan, exerted
his influence still further in schemes of assassination.
Abu Harb Issa (<i>i. e.</i> Jesus, Father of Battles), a rich merchant
of Khojend, a sworn enemy of the Bateni, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>expended large sums in injuring them, arrived at Aleppo
with a rich caravan, consisting of five hundred camels. An
Assassin, a native of Rei, by name Ahmed, son of Nassr,
had accompanied him from the borders of Khorassan, watching
an opportunity to avenge on his person the blood of a brother,
who had fallen under the blows of Abu Harb’s people. On
his arrival at Aleppo, the murderer had a conference with
Abutaher and his protector, Riswan, whom he won the more
easily to his purposes, as the richness of the booty, and
Abu Harb’s known hostility to the Assassins, invited to vengeance.
Abutaher provided Assassins, and Riswan guards,
for the execution of the deed. As Abu Harb was, one day,
counting his camels, surrounded by his slaves, the murderers
attacked him; but before they could pierce their victim’s
heart, they all fell themselves under the blows of the brave
and faithful slaves, who exhibited their courage and attachment
in defence of their master. The princes of Syria, to whom
Abu Harb communicated this attack, loaded Riswan with
reproaches for this scandalous breach of hospitality. He
excused himself with the lie, that he had had no share in the
transaction, and added, to the universal horror of his deed,
the public contempt which eventually falls to the lot of all
liars. Abutaher, in order to escape the daily increasing
rage of the inhabitants of Aleppo against the Ismailites,
returned into his own country to his sanguinary associates.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p>As unsuccessful as their enterprise against Apamea, was
the attack of the Bathenites on Shiser, of which they wished
to deprive the family of Monkad and subject it to themselves.
While the inhabitants of this castle had gone into the town,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
to participate in the festivities of the Christians at the celebration
of Easter, the Assassins took possession of it and barricaded
the gates. On the return of the inhabitants, they were
drawn up through the windows with ropes, by their wives,
during the night, and drove out the Assassins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after, Mewdud, the prince of Mossul, fell under
their daggers at Damascus, as he was walking with Togteghin,
the prince of that city, on a feast day, in the fore court of the
great mosque. An Assassin stabbed him, for which he lost
his head on the spot.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> In the same year<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> died Riswan, the
prince of Aleppo, the great protector of the Ismailites, who
made use of their swords and daggers for the defence and
extension of his power. His death was the signal of theirs:
the eunuch Lulu, who, with Riswan’s son, Akhras, a youth
of sixteen, carried on the government, commenced it with
condemning to death all the Bathenites; which sentence was
executed less in a legal manner than in a promiscuous carnage.</p>

<p>No less than three hundred men, women, and children,
were cut in pieces, and about two hundred thrown into prison
alive. Abulfettah,&mdash;not the one who was tortured to death by
the sons of Khalaf, but a son of Abutaher, the goldsmith, and
his successor, after his return to Persia, as head of the Assassins
in Syria, met with a fate no less horrible and merited
than his namesake: after being hewed to pieces at the gate
looking towards Irak, his limbs were burnt, but his head was
carried about through Syria for a show. The Dai Ismail,
brother of the astrologer, who had first brought himself and
his sect into credit with Riswan, paid for it with his life; several
of the Assassins were thrown from the top of the wall
into the moat; Hossameddin, son of Dimlatsh, a newly-arrived
Dai from Persia, fled from the popular rage to Rakka,
where he died; several also saved themselves by flight, and
were dispersed in the towns of Syria; others, to escape the
fatal suspicion of belonging to the order, denounced their
brothers and murdered them. Their treasures were sought
out and were confiscated.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> They revenged this persecution
variously and sanguinarily. In an audience, granted by the
khalif of Bagdad to Togteghin Atabeg, of Damascus, three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>conspirators in succession attacked the Emir Ahmed Bal, governor
of Khorassan, whom they probably mistook for the
Atabeg. They all three fell, together with the emir, who had
been selected for their daggers, and who was in reality their
sworn foe, and had frequently besieged their castles. The
governors of provinces, as being the principal instruments of
the state for the preservation of peace and good order, were
their natural enemies, and, as such, more than all exposed
to their daggers. Bedii, the governor of Aleppo, became
their victim,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> as also one of his sons, who was on his way to
the court of the Emir Ilghasi. His other sons cut down the
two murderers, but a third sprang forward and gave one of
them, who was already wounded, his death-blow. Being
seized, and carried before the princes Togteghin and Ilghasi,
he was condemned by them only to imprisonment, but he
sought his death by drowning himself.</p>

<p>The following year<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Ilghasi received a message from Abu
Mohammed, the head of the Ismailis in Aleppo, with a request
to put them in possession of the castle of Sherif. Ilghasi,
dreading his power, pretended to grant it; but before the
envoy could return with this consent, the inhabitants of
Aleppo destroyed the walls, filled up the ditches, and united
the castle with the town. Ibn Khashshab, who had made this
proposition, in order not to increase the power of the Ismailites
by the possession of the fortress, paid for it with his
blood. A few years afterwards, they made a similar request
to Nureddin, the celebrated prince of Damascus, for the possession
of the castle Beitlaha; which was, in the same way,
apparently granted, and frustrated by a similar stratagem: for
the inhabitants, secretly instigated by Nureddin, to prevent
the Ismailites obtaining a firm footing, immediately set about
destroying their fortifications. So great was the dread in
which princes held the order, that they did not dare to refuse
them the strong places of their own countries, and preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>destroying them, to abandoning them for citadels of the power
and sovereignty of the Assassins.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>In Persia, also, their vengeance chose the most illustrious
victims. Fakrolmulk<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> (<em>Glory of the kingdom</em>), Abulmosaffer
Ali, the son of the grand vizier Nisam-ol-mulk, who had filled
the office he inherited from his father, along with his hatred
of the Assassins, during the two reigns of the sultans Mohammed
and Sandjar, with credit and industry, and Chakarbeg,
the son of Mikail, brother of Togrul, grand-uncle of Sandjar,
the reigning sultan of the Seljuks, were amongst them.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> A
sanguinary lesson for the latter, whom the son of Sabah
warned by still farther menaces. He found it more adviseable
frequently to restrain his powerful enemies by impending
danger, and preferred unnerving their arm by terror, to multiplying
uselessly avengers by repeated murders. He gained
over a slave of the sultan’s, who, while the latter slept, stuck
a dagger in the ground close to his head. The prince was
terror-struck when, on waking, he espied the murderous
weapon but concealed his fear. Some days after, the grand-master
wrote to him in the style of the order, brief and
cutting like their stilettos: “Had we not been well-disposed
towards the sultan, we might have plunged the dagger into
his heart, instead of the ground.”</p>

<p>Sandjar, who had despatched some troops against the
castles of the Ismailites in Kuhistan, was the more fearful,
after this warning, of prosecuting the siege; as his brother
Mohammed, who had caused the two strongest fortresses of
the Ismailites in Irak, Alamut and Lamsir, to be invested by
the Atabeg Nushteghin Shirghir, for more than a year, died
at the very moment when, being reduced to extremities, they
were on the point of surrendering.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> This death was too
favourable to the Assassins, not to be considered less the
work of accident than of their policy, which, though trusting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>to the dagger, did not neglect the use of poison. Admonished
by this, Sandjar offered to make peace with the Ismailites on
three conditions:&mdash;1st. They should erect no new fortifications
about their castles; 2nd. They should purchase no arms nor
ammunition; and, 3rd. That they should make no more proselytes.
As, however, the jurists, who had thundered the ban of
general condemnation and persecution against the impiety of
the order, would hear of no compromise or peace with them,
the sultan fell under the popular suspicion of being a secret
partisan of their impious doctrines. Peace was, however, concluded
between Hassan and Sandjar; and the latter not only
exempted the Ismailites from all duties and imposts in the
district of Kirdkuh, but even assigned them a certain portion
of the revenues of Kumis, as the annual pension of the order.
Thus, this society of murderers increased daily in power and
authority.</p>

<p>It was not, however, merely since his accession, but twelve
or fourteen years earlier, that the Sultan Sandjar had exhibited
tokens of forbearance towards the Assassins; for on his
journey from Khorassan to Irak, he visited at Damaghan the
Reis Mosaffer, venerable both on account of his age and
influence, who, as we have already seen, had declared himself
an adherent of Hassan Sabah, and had obtained for him, by
stratagem, the treasures of the Emir David Habeshi. Some
officers proposed to demand them back, but on Mosaffer’s
representation, that he had always loaded the inhabitants of
the place with favours, as the proper subjects of the sultan,
the latter lavished honours upon him. Thus died Reis Mosaffer,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
respected and honoured as the patriarch of the new
doctrine, at the age of one hundred and one.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>Hassan Sabah survived the most faithful of his disciples,
and his nearest relations, to whom the ties of attachment and
consanguinity seemed to secure the highest rights to the succession
to the sovereignty. His nephew and grand-prior in
Syria, Abulfettah, had fallen by the sword of the enemy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>Hossein Kaini, grand-prior in Kuhistan, under the dagger of
a murderer, probably Ostad, one of the two sons of Hassan:
and Ostad and his brother under the hand of their own father,
who seemed to revel even in spilling his own blood. Without
proof or measure of guilt, he sacrificed them, not to
offended justice, but apparently to mere love of murder, and
that terrific policy, by virtue of which the order snapped all ties
of relationship or friendship, to bind the more closely those of
impiety and slaughter.</p>

<p>Ostad (i. e. <em>the master</em>), probably so called because the
public voice had destined him as the successor of his father
as grand-master, was put to death on the mere suspicion of
being concerned in Hossein’s murder; and his brother, because
he had drunk wine: the former, probably, because he had, by
his crime, which was without orders, interfered with his
father’s prerogative; the latter, because he had infringed one of
the least essential laws of Islamism, but whose strict observance
was part of the system of the order. In the execution
of his two sons, the grand-master gave the profane and the
initiated a sanguinary example of avenged disobedience to
the ordinance of outward worship, and the rules of internal
discipline; but probably, besides this apparent motive, the
son of Sabah was urged by another, to the destruction of his
race; possibly, his sons, disgusted with the long reign of
their father, were expecting with impatience to succeed him;
it is probable, that on that account he deemed them incompetent,
as not having learned to obey, or as being wanting in the
necessary princely qualities; or, it is probable, that he set
them aside, in order to avoid sinking the order into a dynasty
by inheritance, and that the succession of grand-masters
might be determined by the nearest relationship of mind and
character, irreligion and impiety. Human nature is not usually
so diabolical, that the historian must, among several
doubtful motives to an action, always decide for the worst;
but, in the founder of this society of vice, the establisher of
the murderous order of the Assassins, the most horrible is
the most likely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>Of the most faithful promulgators of the new doctrine, of
whom we have hitherto made mention, there still remained
the Dai Kiabusurgomid, who had not quitted the castle of
Lamin during the twenty years that had elapsed since he
took it, and the Lieutenant Abu Ali, Dai in Kaswin. When
the son of Sabah felt his end approaching, he sent for them to
Alamut; and, by his last will, divided the government between
them in such a manner, that Abu Ali was invested with
the external command and civil administration, and Kiabusurgomid,
as proper grand-master, with the supreme spiritual
power and government of the order. Thus, at a very advanced
age, died Hassan Sabah;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> for more than seventy years had
elapsed, since, as a youth of twenty, he studied with Nisam-ol-mulk,
under the Imam Mowasek, in the reign of Togrul.
He expired, not on the bed of torture, which his crimes
merited, but in his own; not under the poniards, which he
had drawn against the hearts of the best and greatest of his
contemporaries, but by the natural effect of age; after a
blood-stained reign of thirty-five years, during which he not
only never quitted the castle of Alamut, but had never removed
more than twice, during this long period, from his
chamber to the terrace. Immoveable in one spot, and persisting
in one plan, he meditated the revolutions of empires
by carnage and rebellion; or wrote rules for his order, and
the catechism of the secret doctrine of libertinism and impiety.
Fixed in the centre of his power, he extended its circumference
to the extreme confines of Khorassan and Syria; with
the pen in his hand, he guided the daggers of his Assassins.
He was, himself, in the hand of Providence, like war and
pestilence,&mdash;a dreadful scourge for the chastisement of feeble
sovereigns and corrupted nations.</p>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Reign of Kia Busurgomid, and his Son, Mohammed.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>K</big>ia Busurgomid</span>, who had been the general and Dai of
Hassan, succeeded him in the spiritual power; and trod precisely
in the sanguinary steps of the founder of the order.
Daggers and fortresses were the foundations of Hassan’s
power, and that of his successor rested on the same basis; the
most illustrious leaders of the enemy either fell, or were tottering
to their fall. New castles were taken or built. Thus, that
of Maimundis was erected;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> the ruin of which drew with it, in
the sequel, the death of the grand-master, and the suppression
of the order. Abdolmelek was declared its dehdar, or commandant.
These precautions were the more necessary, as
the Sultan Sandjar, who had long been deemed a secret
protector of the order, now publicly declared himself their
enemy. In the month Shaaban, of the same year, also,
Atabeg Shirghir, overran the province of Rudbar with an
army. The body, which the grand-master sent against him,
put the enemy to flight, and carried off a rich booty.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>The war, the year following,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> assumed a still more cruel
character, when a great multitude of Bathenites were put to
the sword, by order of Sandjar; nor was it altered on Mahmud’s
succeeding to the throne of Irak, in the place of his
nephew, Sandjar.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> This sovereign resolved to combat the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>Assassins with their own weapons of perfidy and murder; a
determination unworthy the assertor of a good cause. After
being some time at open war with Kia Busurg, the sultan requested,
through the medium of his grand falconer, that
some one should be sent from Alamut, on the part of the
grand-master, to treat of peace. The Khoja Mohammed
Nassihi Sheristani was sent: he was admitted to the honour
of kissing the sultan’s hand, who addressed a few words to
him on the subject of peace. On leaving the presence, the
Khoja, or master, and his accompanying Refik (fellow) were
savagely butchered by the populace.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<p>Mahmud despatched an envoy to Alamut, to excuse this
action; in which, according to his own asseverations, he had
had no share. Kia Busurg made answer to the envoy: “Go
back to the sultan, and tell him, in my name, Mohammed
Nassihi trusted to your perfidious assurances, and repaired
to your court; if you speak truly, deliver up the murderers
to justice; if not, expect my vengeance.” Mahmud not attending
to this, a body of Assassins came to the very gates of
Kaswin,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> where they killed four hundred men, and carried off
three thousand sheep, two hundred horses and camels, and two
hundred oxen and asses. The inhabitants followed them, but
the death of one of their chief men interrupted their pursuit.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>The year following,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> the sultan captured, though but for a
brief period, Alamut itself, the stronghold of the order’s sovereignty;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
and immediately after, a thousand men were sent
against the castle of Lamsir, who, as soon as they heard that
the Refik, or companions of the order, were in advance against
them, instantly fled without striking a blow. Immediately
after the death of Mahmud, which was most probably caused
by the machinations of the Assassins, without, however, any
accusation of the kind, the companions of the order made a
second irruption into the environs of Kaswin,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> and carried off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>two hundred horses, and after killing a hundred Turcomans,
and twenty of the citizens, they retired. The forces of Alamut
then marched against Abu Hashem, a descendant of Ali,
who had usurped the dignity of imam in Ghilan, and invited
the people, by manifestos, to recognize him as their legitimate
lord. Kia Busurg wrote to him, advising him to desist from
his aspiring projects; he, however, replied, with reviling the
impious lore of the Ismailites: they made war upon him, beat
him in Dilem, took him prisoner, and, after holding a council
of war, delivered him over to the stake.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>On the death of Mahmud, when Messud ascended the
throne of the Seljukides, Itsis, the prince of Khowaresm, a
country lying between the confines of Khorassan, and the
mouth of the Oxus, came to him, to communicate the determination
he had formed, of exterminating the Ismailites.
Although the large province of Khorassan lies between Khowaresm
and Kuhistan, or the Highlands, where the Ismailis
nestled, like birds of prey, amongst the rocks, yet the sovereign
of Khowaresm, not unjustly, dreaded the approach of
such dangerous neighbours, whose poniards reached even
their most distant foes. Messud, participating in the maxims
and designs of Itsis, presented him with the fief which
had been held by Berenkish, the grand falconer, who in his
irritation, took refuge with Kiabusurg, and sent his wives
and children to the castle of Dherkos, which was in the
possession of the Ismailites. Although this man, till now
their declared enemy, had not only attacked them in open warfare,
but also with their own weapons, perfidy and treachery,
the grand-master considered it politic to exercise the rights
of hospitality towards him, who had now flown to their
protection. It was the more advisable to create a new friend
to the order, as Khowaresmshah, who had hitherto shown
tokens of a friendly disposition, had, all at once, declared himself
an enemy. The latter sent the following message to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>grand-master: “Berenkish and his party were heretofore
your declared enemies; I, on the other hand, was bound to
you by true attachment. Now that the sultan has given me
his fief, he has sought an asylum with you; if you will deliver
him up to me, our friendship will receive still further increase.”
Kiabusurg replied: “Khowaresmshah speaks truly, but we
will never surrender our protegés to the enemy.” This was
the origin of tedious hostilities between Khowaresmshah
and Kiabusurg.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>It was natural that princes, who, for a time, were blinded
by the representations of the Dais, and the attractions of the
Ismailitic secret doctrine, should have hastened, as friends,
to their arms, but should afterwards snatch themselves away,
dreading lest the embrace, like that of the Spanish maiden,
should be but a form of execution, under which murdering
daggers lay concealed. Thus, the Sultan Sandjar, and Itsis,
shah of Khowaresm, who were both at first reckoned among
the friends and partisans of the order, became their open foes;
and we have seen that, at Aleppo, they enjoyed, during the
reign of Riswan, the most powerful influence; but, under his
son, were extirpated with the sword. Such was their fate
also at Damascus; where, during the reign of Busi, they
found a powerful protector in the vizier Tahir, the son of
Saad of Masdeghan. The Persian Assassin, Behram of Astrabad,
who commenced his operations with the murder of his
uncle, gained over the vizier, who gave him the castle of
Banias, as Riswan had given the more inland fortress, Sarmin,
to the nephew of Hassan Sabah.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Banias, the ancient Balanea,
signifying the old city seated in the little bay, gave its name
to the castle newly erected in A. D. 1162; A. H. 454. It is
a farsang, or four thousand paces, distant from the sea, in a
fertile, well-watered plain; where, in former times, more
than a hundred thousand buffaloes found pasture.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>valley, into which numerous rivulets fall, is called Wady ol
Jinn (the valley of demons), a place whose very name rendered
it worthy of being a settlement of Assassins. From this
place,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> they became masters of the surrounding castles and
towns; and Banias became the centre of their power in Syria,
until they transferred it, twelve years afterwards, to Massiat.</p>

<p>Behram had long prosecuted the designs of the order at
Aleppo and Damascus, where he was recognised and favoured
as Dai, by the princes Ilghasi and Togteghin. When, by the
possession of Banias, he had obtained a firm footing in Syria,
the power and insolence of the Assassins attained its height.
From all sides they hastened to the new point of union, and
princes did not venture to protect any one against them.
The jurists and theologians, more particularly the Soonnites,
those universal victims, were struck dumb with fear of them,
and of the disfavour of the princes. Behram did not fall by
their vengeance, but by that of the inhabitants of the valley
of Taim, an appendage to the district of Baalbek, and inhabited
by a mixture of Nossairis, Druses, and Magians. Their
brave leader, Dohak, burned to revenge the death of his
brother Barak, the son of Jendel, who had been slain by the
Assassins, by command of Behram; he united, for this purpose,
the warriors of his native vale, with succours from
Damascus, and the surrounding towns. Behram hoped to
surprise them defenceless, at the head of his Ismailites; he,
however, fell into their hands, and was instantly cut in pieces.
His head and hands were brought to Egypt, where the khalif
presented the bearer with a rich habit, and had them carried
about in triumph in Cairo and Fostath. The Ismailis who
escaped, fled from the valley of Taim, to Banias, where Behram,
prior to the expedition, had committed the command to Ismail,
the Persian. The vizier Masdeghani entered into friendly
alliance with him, as with his predecessor. Ismail sent to
Damascus, one of his creatures, Abulwefa, literally, <em>Father of</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span><em>Fidelity</em>, but, in reality, the model of perfidiousness.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> By his
intrigues, he succeeded in obtaining, not only the office of
Dailkebir, or prior of the Ismailites, but also that of Hakem,
or chief judge of the district.</p>

<p>At Cairo, the dignity of grand-master of the lodge (Dail-doat),
was frequently united by the Ismailites, with that of
chief justice (Kadhi al Kodhat). As the attainment of rule
was the object of the order, and as no means were left untried
to accomplish it, Abulwefa sought conquest by means of
treachery, and greatness by perjury. The Crusaders, whose
power was continually on the increase in Syria, appeared to
him the most fitting instruments of his ambitious designs.
As the enemies of Mohammedanism, they were the natural
allies of its most dangerous opponents. The bulwarks of the
faith of Mohammed, shaken from without by the tempest of
the Crusaders, and undermined from within by the atheistical
doctrines of the Assassins, threatened an earlier and a more
certain fall; and the pious warriors, in union with their impious
allies, promised the sooner to erect the cross and the
dagger on their ruins. Abulwefa entered into a treaty with
the king of Jerusalem, by which he bound himself, on a certain
Friday, to put the city of Damascus in his possession. While
the Emir Busi, and his magnates, both courtly and military,
were assembled at their devotions in the mosque, all the
approaches to it were to be hemmed in by conspirators, and
the gates of the city opened to the Christians. In return for
this service, the king promised to deliver the city of Tyre
into his power.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<p>Hugo de Payens, the first grand-master of the Templars,
seems to have been the principal agent in urging Baldwin II.,
King of Jerusalem, to this strange alliance of the cross and
the dagger. For ten years after its first institution,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>order remained in obscurity; fulfilling, besides the usual
evangelical vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, a fourth,
the protection of pilgrims; but still existing only as a private
society, without statutes or knightly habits.</p>

<p>By the code of rules given by St. Bernard, and confirmed
by Pope Honorius I., it raised itself at once, to the splendour
of a powerful chivalric order, for the defence of the holy
sepulchre, and the protection of the pilgrims.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> According to
Miræus, its members consisted of knights, esquires, and lay-brothers,
which answer to the companions (Refik), agents
(Fedavi), and laymen (Lassick), of the Ismailites, as the
priors, grand-priors, and grand-master, did to the Dai, Dailkebir,
and Sheikh of the mountain. As the Refik were
clothed in white, with red insignia, so the knights wore white
mantles with red crosses; and as the castles of the Assassins
arose in Asia, so did the hospitals of the Templars in Europe.</p>

<p>The grand-master Hugo, came this year<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> to Jerusalem,
accompanied by a great retinue of knights and pilgrims, who,
at his exhortation, had assumed the cross, and taken up arms
in defence of the holy sepulchre.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> The siege of Damascus
was immediately decided upon. After the death of the
dreaded Togteghin, which had but lately occurred, his son
Taj-ol-Moluk<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Busi succeeded him. In his name, the vizier
Tahir-ben-Saad exercised the supreme power, and, through
him, the chiefs of the Ismailites, first the warrior Behram,
afterwards the judge Abulwefa, with whom the treacherous surrender
of Damascus, in exchange for Tyre, was agreed upon.</p>

<p>Taj-ol-Moluk Busi having received timely notice of the designs
of the Ismailites, caused his vizier, the son of Saad, to be
put to death; and then gave orders for a general massacre of
all of the order who were in the city. Six thousand fell by the
sword, which avenged the victims of the dagger. It was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>an execution, but an indiscriminate slaughter. In the meanwhile,
a numerous Christian army, certain of the promised
surrender of the city, had advanced on the road to Damascus,
as far as Marj Safar. Among them, besides many pilgrims
of the west, were the king and barons of Jerusalem, with
their allies, Prince Bernard of Antioch, Pontius, Count of
Tripoli, and Joscelin of Edessa, with many knights and esquires.
The soldiery, under the command of the constable,
William of Buris, had gone with a thousand knights, to plunder
the villages, and collect provisions; marching, however,
as was usual with an army of pilgrims, without order and
discipline, they were, with many of the knights, almost entirely
destroyed, by an attack of a small body of valiant warriors
from Damascus. The rest, as soon as they learned the
disgraceful defeat of their brethren, flew to arms, and hastened
to attack the Damascenes; to wash out with their blood the
stain inflicted on the Christian army.</p>

<p>A dreadful darkness, however, came on, interrupted only
by the glare of the lightning and howling of the tempest; in
the midst of the thunder, the cataracts of heaven poured
down rain, and inundated the roads, when suddenly, as if the
order of the seasons had at once been changed&mdash;as if summer
and winter would together have raged in all their severity,
the rain and flood were changed to snow and ice. Such rapid
mutations of the atmosphere, and sudden vicissitudes of the
weather, from one extreme to the other, are not, indeed, rare
in those countries; but they astonished the inexperienced
wanderers, as extraordinary phenomena of nature.</p>

<p>The author of the present work has, during his travels,
more than once experienced this, and in a terribly sublime
manner, in the defile of Marmaris; as did the British fleet, and
the Egyptian army of occupation. Heavy clouds darkened
the approach of night; torrents of rain, which poured from
them and from the rocks, carried away arms and tents; the
howling of the storm and the roaring of the thunder, drowned
the speaking-trumpets of the distressed ships, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
driving from their anchors. On the cessation of the tempest,
which lasted the whole night, and grew calmer towards morning,
the first dawn showed the masts dashed to pieces by the
wind, and the rocks scathed by the lightning, and covered
with a large quantity of snow.</p>

<p>The army of the Gauls, which, in ancient times, under
the command of Brennus, sacked the temple of Delphi, experienced
a similar contest and alternation of seasons, and an
equally violent storm.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> And as, at that time, these natural
phenomena were deemed a token of the celestial punishment
of the sacrilegious presumption of the Gauls, so were they
also considered by the Crusaders as a mark of the anger
of Heaven at their sins, and their late compact with the
Assassins, which blood and perjury could alone confirm.
The only advantage which they derived from this monstrous
union of piety and impiety, was the possession of the castle
of Banias, which the commander, Ismail, fearing lest he
should meet the fate of his brethren of Damascus, delivered
up to the knight, Rainier de Brus, the same year,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> in which
the fortress of Alamut surrendered to Sultan Mahmud. Thus
fell, at the same time, the two citadels of the order in Persia
and Syria, and so near was the risk of its complete annihilation.</p>

<p>A persevering spirit of enterprise, however, overcame
the untowardness of events. Both Alamut and Banias soon
returned to their former possessors. The latter was re-taken,
three years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> by Ismail, while Rainier de Brus and
his soldiery lay before Joppa, with the king of Jerusalem.
Among the prisoners who were carried away, Rainier lost a
beloved wife; whom, on her release during a truce with
Ismail, he received affectionately, but repulsed her on learning
that she had neither preserved her faith among the
infidels, nor her honour among the impious. She con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>fessed
her sin, and retired into a convent of devout females
at Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>The less the designs of the Ismailites prospered by the
sword, the more successful and persevering were they with
the dagger; and, however dangerous to the order the times
might be, they were not the less so to its most powerful
adversaries. A long series of great and celebrated men,
who, during the grand-mastership of Kiabusurgomid, fell by
the poniards of his Fedavi, signalized the bloody annals of
his reign; and, as formerly, according to the fashion of
oriental historians, there follows, at the end of each prince’s
reign, a catalogue of great statesmen, generals, and literati,
who have either adorned it by their lives, or troubled it with
their death; so, in the annals of the Assassins, is found the
chronological enumeration of celebrated men of all nations
who have fallen the victims of the Ismailites, to the joy of
their murderers, and the sorrow of the world. The first,
under the grand-mastership of Kiabusurgomid, was Cassim-ed-dewlet<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>
Aksonkor Bourshi, the brave prince of Mossul,
feared alike by the Crusaders and the Assassins, as one of
their deadliest enemies.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Having fought his last battle with
the former, near Maarra Mesrin, he was, on the first Sunday
after his return,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> attacked by eight Assassins, disguised as
dervishes, as he was in the act of seating himself on his
throne in the mosque at Mossul: protected by a coat of mail
and his natural bravery, he defended himself against the
wretches, three of whom he stretched at his feet; but before
his retinue could hasten to his assistance, he received a
mortal wound, from the effects of which he expired the
same day. The remaining Assassins were sacrificed to the
vengeance of the populace, with the exception of one young
man from the village of Katarnash, in the mountains near
Eras, whose mother, on hearing of Aksonkor’s murder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>dressed and adorned herself for joy at the successful issue of
the attempt, in which her son had devoted his life; but, on
his returning alone, she cut off her hair, and blackened her
face, with the deepest sorrow, that he had not shared the
murderers’ honourable death. To such lengths did the Assassins
carry their point of honour, and what may be termed
their Spartanism.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Moineddin, the vizier of Sultan Sandjar, was also murdered<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
by an Assassin, hired by his enemy, Derkesina, the
vizier of Mohammed, and a friend of the Ismailites. In
order the better to attain his object, the ruffian entered his
service as a groom. One day, as the vizier went into the
stable to inspect his horses, the false groom appeared before
him without clothes, in order to avoid all suspicion of carrying
concealed weapons, although he had hidden his dagger in
the mane of the horse, whose bridle he was holding. The
horse reared, and under pretence of quieting him with
caresses, he snatched his poniard, and stabbed the vizier.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>If Bourshi, Prince of Mossul, stood on the list of the
victims of the Ismailites solely because he was the rival of
their power; and an obstacle to their greatness, we shall not
be surprised at finding the name of Busi, the Prince of
Damascus, by whose orders the Vizier Masdeghani, and six
thousand Assassins, had been massacred. The slightest
pretence was sufficient to cause the blood of princes to flow
beneath their stilettos; how much more when their own called
as in this latter case, for revenge. To escape was beyond
the power of prudence, as they watched for years for time,
place, and opportunity. Busi, the son of Togteghin, was,
in the second year after the massacre,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> attacked by its
avengers, and received two wounds, one of which healed
immediately; the other was, however, mortal, the following
year.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>The vengeance of the Assassins seems to to have descended
from father to son: Shems-ol-Moluk (<em>the sun of the king</em>),
the son of Busi, and grandson of Togteghin, fell a victim to
a conspiracy.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> There fell, besides, under the daggers of the
order, the judges of the east and the west, Abusaid Herawi,
the mufti of Kaswin, Hassan-ben-Abelkassem; the reis of
Ispahan, Seid Dewletshah; and the reis of Tebris.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> These
were the most celebrated of a numerous body of officers of
state and jurists, who perished in heaps and unnamed. To
drag from amongst the murdered the most splendid victims,
is the melancholy and sorrowful duty of the historian of the
Assassins.</p>

<p>Hitherto, their attacks had been directed only against
viziers and emirs, the subordinate instruments of the khalif’s
power; and the throne itself, which they were undermining,
had remained unstained by the blood of its possessors. The
period, however, was now arrived, in which the order dared
to seal their doctrine with the blood of those khalifs, to whom
it was so destructive, and to deprive the successors of the
prophet not merely of their temporal power, but likewise of
their lives. The shadow of God on earth, as the khalifs
called themselves, was, indeed, a mere shadow of earthly
power; and was, when he would have asserted more, sent,
by the dagger of the Assassin to the shades below.</p>

<p>We have seen, that the secret doctrine of the Ismailites
derived its origin from the lodge at Cairo, long before the
foundation of the order, of the Assassins; and flourished
under the protection of the Fatimites, the rivals of the
Assassins, and their competitors for the throne. By a just
retribution, this protection of a doctrine of irreligion and
immorality was avenged on the Fatimites themselves, by the
murderous order which sprung from it. The Egyptian
khalif, Emr Biahkamillah Abu Ali Manssur,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> tenth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>Fatimite dynasty (whose founder, Obeidollah, had made the
lodge of the secret doctrine a part of his ministerial policy),
fell, in the twenty-ninth year of his reign, under the dagger
of the Assassin.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>It is not clear whether his death proceeded from the
policy of the order, or the private revenge of the family of
the powerful Vizier Efdhal.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> This emir was equally dangerous
to the Christians by the zeal with which he prosecuted
the war, and to the khalif, by his colossal power in
the state. He was murdered by two Assassins, of whom it
is uncertain whether they were the instruments of their
superiors, at that time in alliance with the Crusaders, or the
hirelings of the khalif. The latter is probable, from the circumstance
that Abu Ali, the son of Efdhal, was, immediately
after his death, thrown into prison, and on being
set at liberty after the murder of the khalif, was invested
with his father’s dignity. As, however, Abu Ali himself
shortly after fell by the dagger, it appears that these two
assassinations proceeded from the profound policy of the concealed
fomentors. From this period, Egypt became a scene
of disorder and confusion, occasioned by the violent contests
between the partisans of the khalif thrones of Cairo and
Bagdad. Mostarshedbillah-Abu-Manssur-Fasl, the twenty-ninth
Abbasside khalif, sustained himself on the latter for
seventeen years, though constantly tottering.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the Seljukide sultans who had, under the pretext
of being the protectors of the khalifat of Bagdad,
assumed all the temporal power, had, at least, left to the
Abbasside khalif the two highest prerogatives of Islamism,&mdash;the
mint, and prayers from the pulpit on Fridays. If they
stamped any coin, it was in the name of the khalif; for whom,
likewise, they prayed weekly in the mosques. Messud was
the first to appoint the khatibs, or Friday prayer, to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>his own name; an injury which Mostarshed was obliged,
however unwilling, to endure, as he was not strong enough
to resent it. A few years afterwards, however, when some
dissatisfied chieftains deserted with their troops from Messud
to Mostarshed, they persuaded the latter that it would be
easy to subdue the sultan; he, in consequence, took the field
against him. In the very first engagement, the khalif was
abandoned by the greater part of his troops, and taken
prisoner by Messud, who carried him to Meragha, on his
campaign against his own nephew, David.</p>

<p>A treaty was concluded, by which the khalif engaged to
confine himself within the walls of Bagdad, and to pay the
sultan an annual tribute. This composition deceived the
expectations of the Ismailites, who had hoped that the result
of this war, between the sultan and the khalif, would be the
destruction of the latter: the grand-master, therefore, resolved
to complete what the sultan had begun; and that,
though the khalif had escaped the sword, he should not be
spared by the dagger. In the camp, two farsangs from
Meragha, while Messud was absent, having gone to meet the
ambassadors of Sandjar, Assassins put the khalif and his
immediate suite to death;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> and not content with that foul
deed, mutilated the dead, in the most horrible manner, by
cutting off the noses and ears; as though they would, to the
treason of a khalif’s murder, add insults to his corpse.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<h3><i>Reign of Mohammed, Son of Kia Busurgomid.</i></h3>

<p>After a blood-stained reign of fourteen years and three
days, Kia Busurgomid, feeling his end approaching, named his
son, Mohammed, as successor in the grand-mastership of the
order; either because he really found none other worthy of
the office, or that the natural desire of making the sovereignty
hereditary in his family caused him to depart from the spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>of the fundamental maxims of the order, as they had been
sketched out by Hassan Sabah. Be that as it may, the
office, which, without respect to relationship, ought to have
depended on the nomination of the existing grand-master,
remained hereditary in the family of Busurgomid to the fall
of the order. His death was, at first, a cause of great joy
to the enemies of the Ismailites; when, however, they perceived
that his son drove the chariot of restless ambition in
the bloody track of his father, all Asia again sank into
despair. He began, as his father had ended, with regicide;
and before the votaries of Islam had time to recover from
the consternation, with which the murder of the Khalif Mostarshed
had overwhelmed them, their ears were horror-stricken
with the intelligence of the fate of Rashid, his
successor. The order had hoped, by the violent death of
Mostarshed, to succeed in involving the khalifat in confusion
and immediately effecting its ruin. This expectation, however,
proving fallacious; and Rashid, immediately on taking
possession of the vacant throne, and ere he was firmly seated
on it, meditating revenge against his father’s butchers, the
new grand-master resolved to begin where his predecessor
had ended, and to heap murder on murder, crime on crime,
and to add regicide to treason.</p>

<p>The khalif went from Ramadan to Ispahan where he
had just begun to recover from an attack of illness. Four
Assassins, natives of Khorassan, and who had mingled with
his retinue, watched an opportunity of stealing into his tent,
and poniarded him. He was buried on the spot where he
fell; and the troops which he had collected from Bagdad, for
the purpose of a campaign against the Ismailites, dispersed.
When the news of this successful atrocity, and the frustrated
expedition reached Alamut, the residence of the grand-master,
public festivals and rejoicings were appointed on the occasion.
For seven days and seven nights the kettle drums and cornets
echoed from the turrets of the fortress, and published to the
surrounding castles the jubilee of crime and the triumph of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
murder. Proofs so cutting as the Assassins’ daggers (to use
an expression of Mirkhond) raised their claims beyond the
reach of doubts, and imposed the silence of the grave on
their opponents.</p>

<p>A terror but too well founded seized the khalifs of the
race of Abbas, who, henceforth, did not venture to show
themselves in public. The companions of impiety (Refik),
and the dedicated to murder (Fedavi), spread themselves in
troops over the whole of Asia, and darkened the face of the
earth. The castles already in their possession were maintained
and fortified, and new ones built or purchased. Thus
they obtained in Syria, Kadmos, Kahaf, and Massiat: the
two former were sold to them by Ibn Amrun;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> the latter they
wrested from the commandant of the lords of Sheiser,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> and
made it the centre of their Syrian power, where, even now,
traces of it are to be found.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>While the order was thus aggrandizing itself, and striking
its foes with terror, by the acquisition of strong places and
the use of the dagger, the fundamental maxim, which separated
so completely the secret doctrine of the initiated from the
public tenets of the people, was observed to the letter; and
the fulfilment of the injunctions of Mohammedanism was the
more strictly exacted, the more indifferent the superiors considered
faith and morals to be to themselves. The people
saw only the effect of their terrible power, without perceiving
the moving force, or its instruments. They saw, in the
numerous victims of the poniard, only the enemies of the
order and religion, which the vengeance of heaven had visited
by the arm of a secret tribunal. The grand-master, his
priors and envoys, did not preach sovereignty in their own
name, or in that of their order, but of the invisible imam, of
whom they called themselves the apostles, and who was to
appear, at some future period, to assert his right to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>dominion of the earth with a conqueror’s power. Their
doctrine was enveloped in a veil of the profoundest mystery,
and ostensibly its maintainers appeared only as strict observers
of the rites of Islamism. A proof of this is afforded
by the answer given to the envoy of Sultan Sandjar, who
had been sent from Rei to collect official information concerning
the Ismailitic doctrines. He was told by the
superiors, “Our doctrine is as follows: we believe in the
unity of God, and consider that only as true wisdom, which
accords with His word and the commands of the prophet;
we observe these, as they are given in the holy book of the
Koran; we believe in all that the prophet has taught concerning
the creation and the last day, rewards and punishments,
the judgment and the resurrection. To believe this
is necessary, and no one is permitted to pass his judgment
on God’s commands, or even to alter a letter of them. These
are the fundamental rules of our sect; and if the sultan
approves them not, he may send one of his theologians to
enter into polemical discussions on the subject.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>In this spirit, during the reign of Kia Mohammed, which
lasted twenty-five years,&mdash;that of his father, Kia Busurgomid,
of fourteen years,&mdash;and that of the founder, Hassan Sabah,
of thirty-five, the external rites of Islamism were strictly
observed. Kia Mohammed, however, had neither the intellect
nor the experience of his predecessors; and it soon appeared
what an error Kia Busurgomid had committed, in consulting,
in his choice of a successor, the ties of kindred rather than
innate talent. From his want of knowledge and capacity,
Kia Mohammed was but little esteemed by the people, who
transferred their attachment to his son, Hassan. The latter
was regarded as a man of great attainments, and he availed
himself of the good opinion of the ignorant multitude, not for
the general interest of the order, but entirely contrary to
its institutions, to serve the purposes of his own private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>ambition. Initiated into all the mysteries of the secret
doctrine, deeply versed in philosophy and history, he stood
forward as a popular teacher and expounder, and favoured the
report which had begun to be spread abroad, that he was the
imam promised by Hassan-ben-Sabah. The companions of
the order respected him more and more every day, and
rivalled each other in the promptitude with which they
executed his behests.</p>

<p>Kia Mohammed, on learning his son’s conduct, and the
disposition of the people, convened them, and declaring his
disapprobation of the proceedings of the former, said, “Hassan
is my son, and I am not the imam, but one of his
precursors. Whoever maintains the contrary is an infidel.”
Two hundred and fifty of his son’s adherents were put to
death, and as many more were banished. Hassan, fearing
his father’s anger, himself anathematised the illuminati, and
wrote treatises in which he condemned the opinions of his
partisans, and asserted those of his father. In this manner
he succeeded, by his dissimulation, in preserving his own
head, and obliterating all suspicion from his father’s mind.
As, however, he was in the habit of drinking wine in secret,
and permitted himself to practise what was forbidden, his
adherents saw, in these actions, new indications of his mission
as the promised imam, whose advent was to abrogate all
prohibitory commands.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>About this period, nearly all the Asiatic monarchies were
revolutionized by the change of the order of succession; and
new dynasties arose on the ruins of their predecessors. As
the order of the Ismailites was inimical to all rulers, and
treated hostilely by most of them, and as they infused into
all governments the envenomed and pernicious influence of
murder and sedition, their history stands in close relation
with that of all the contemporaneously paramount dynasties;
and a glance at the reigning families of Asia will not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>out of place here. From the confines of Khorassan to the
mountains of Syria, from the Musdoramus to Lebanon, from
the Caspian to the Mediterranean, extended the widely spread
ramifications of the empire of the Assassins; their centre being
the grand-master, in his mountain fort of Alamut, in Irak.</p>

<p>We shall take a cursory glance at these broad regions of
Asia, according to the political divisions of the period, and
proceeding in natural geographical order, from east to west,
our progress will commence with Khorassan and terminate
in Syria.</p>

<p>Khorassan, however, first deserves mention not merely
on account of its geographical position and its immediate
vicinity to Kuhistan, the eastern grand-priorate of the order,
but also by reason of the preponderating power of Sultan
Sandjar, whose dominion had been founded at the same epoch
as that of Hassan Sabah, and whose reign had proceeded
contemporaneously with the first three grand-masters, and
terminated only with his death, four years earlier than that
of Kia Mohammed, the third grand-master.</p>

<p>Moeseddin Abulharess Sandjar, one of the greatest princes
of the Seljukide race, and of the east, received, after the
demise of his father, the Sultan Melekshah, which, as we
have seen, occurred immediately after the occupation of
Alamut by Hassan Sabah,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> the vice-royalty of Khorassan,
which province he governed, for twenty years, in the name
of his brothers, Barkyarok and Mohammed, who, as the
heads of the Seljuk family, reigned in Irak.</p>

<p>On the death of his brother Mohammed, in the first year
of the sixth century of the Hegira,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Sandjar took possession
of his states. He made war upon his nephew, Mahmud, who
wished to assert his paternal rights, defeated him, and at
length, when the sagacity of the vizier Kemaleddin Ali had
mediated a peace, allotted him his paternal kingdom, as a fief,
upon the following four conditions: 1st. That in the public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>prayers in the mosques, on Fridays, the name of Sultan
Sandjar should stand before that of Mahmud (the prayers
and the mint are the first regal prerogatives of Islam);
2nd. That the latter should have only three curtains to the
door of his hall of audience (Sultan Sandjar had four, and the
khalif seven; to raise and lower which was the office of the
Hajeb, or chief chamberlain); 3rd. That no trumpet should
sound on his entrance or exit from his palace (a flourish of
trumpets was, at that time, the privilege of sovereigns, as is,
at this day, the ringing of bells a mark of distinction for their
representatives); 4th. That he should retain in their dignities
the officers appointed by his uncle.</p>

<p>Mahmud submitted to these conditions; and as only the
name and appearance of rule were left him, he embraced the
wise resolution of not involving himself deeper in political
matters, but devoting himself entirely to the pleasures of
the chase, which, as an exercise and school of war, has,
from remote antiquity, been considered, in the east, less
as a princely amusement than a royal occupation. (Hence
Nimrod was a mighty hunter before the Lord, and Cyrus an
arranger of hunting; hence, too, the most ancient monarchs of
the Assyrians and Persians are represented on the monuments
of Persepolis, and the amulets excavated from the ruins of
Babylon, as engaged in an heroic combat with wild animals;
hence, in the last Persian dynasty, the cognomen of the “Wild
Ass,” was given to Behramgur, one of their bravest and
sport-loving princes: and hence, likewise, the immense park
or royal chase of Khosru Parwis). In this spirit, Mahmud
expended his treasure in the splendour of his hunting equipments;
he had a pack of four hundred hounds, with gold
collars and housings embroidered with pearls.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<p>Thirty years after this peace between Mahmud and Sandjar,
Behramshah, the last prince but one of the once powerful
dynasty of the sultans of Gasna, attempted to shake off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>yoke of the Seljukides; feeling, however, the enterprise to be
beyond his powers, he sent ambassadors to renew his homage
to Sandjar. With him he succeeded, but not so with Hossein
Jehansus, the founder of the Indian dynasty of the Gurides,
who, about this time,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> raised themselves on the ruin of the
power of the Gasnewides. Behramshah, the Gasnewide,
yielded to the power of Hossein, the Guride, as did the
latter to that of Sultan Sandjar, who drove the founder of
the Gurides out of Khorassan, and then appointed him his
viceroy of the Indian province of Gur (whence the name of
the dynasty). The fortune, which had smiled on Sandjar in
his enterprises against Mahmud, Behramshah, and Hossein,
was not so favourable to him, in his wars against the people
of Karakhatai, whom he attacked in the obscurity of their
forests; nor against the Turcomans of the race of Oghuz,
who invaded Khorassan. He lost, in the battle which he
fought with Gurjash, the prince of the former, thirty thousand
men, together with his harem; and Tarkhau Khatun, the first
of his wives, was made captive by the Karakhtaiyis.</p>

<p>Still worse was his success against the Oghuz Turcomans,
whom he wished to compel to an annual tribute of sheep, which
they refused. He was taken prisoner by them, and confined,
for four years, in an iron cage. The Turkish historians, who
relate this unworthy treatment of the great Sultan Sandjar,
deny Sultan Bajazet’s having experienced the same from his
conqueror, Timur.</p>

<p>Concerning this last, European writers add, that whenever
he mounted his horse, he placed his foot on the neck of the
Ottoman sultan, as, it is said, the Persian king, Shabur
(Sapor), had done a thousand years before, to his captive, the
Roman emperor, Valerian. Valerian and Bajazet perished in
the captivity of Shabur and Timur; but Sandjar had the good
fortune to make his escape from his barbarous conquerors,
and returned to Khorassan, where he died the following year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>from melancholy, caused by his bad fortune, and the desolation
of his states; after a reign of fifty-one years, and a life
of nearly a hundred, as he had before he became sole ruler,
acted, for twenty-one years, as viceroy of his brothers, in
Khorassan. His brilliant exploits, and the encomiums of
the poets, have caused his name to shine among those of
the most illustrious princes of the east; and have not
undeservedly gained him the surname of Alexander the
Second. The greatest poets of his time, Selmar and Ferideddin
Katib, sang his praise; but, above all, Enweri, the
Persian Pindar. Unequalled in his panegyrics, either by his
predecessor, Khakani, or his follower, Farjabi, who, with him,
form the astral triangle of Persian panegyrists, he raised the
name of Sandjar high above the regions of earth in the light
of the milky way, and to the highest heavens, in the midst
of the music of the spheres. While Enweri thus bestowed
immortality on Sandjar in his works, the poet Sabir did him a
no less essential service in prolonging his sublunary existence,
by protecting him from the murderous dagger.</p>

<p>When Itsis, the governor of Khowaresm, rebelled against
Sandjar, the latter sent the poet, one of the most faithful and
respected in his court, secretly to Khorassan, as a spy upon
the designs of the rebellious governor. He succeeded in
ascertaining that Itsis had engaged an Assassin (Fedavi), to
murder the sultan, in the mosque, on a Friday. The murderer
was discovered, by means of the exact description
sent by Sabir to Sandjar, and, after confessing every thing, he
was put to death. Itsis, however, who was aware that Sabir
had caused his design to fail, had him drowned in the Oxus.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
Sabir thus gained an immortal name, in the ranks of great
poets and faithful servants, not only by his encomiastic
poems, but also by his praiseworthy deeds. Sandjar, who, at
first, had been favourably inclined towards the Assassins,
seems to have had his eyes opened by this attempt, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>have been urged to the severity with which, as we have
already related, in his latter years, he pursued the order who
had caused the irruption of the Turcomans.</p>

<p>Sandjar, if not the most dangerous, was yet, at this period,
the most powerful of the enemies of the Ismailites. With
the exception of the phantom of spiritual power, which sat
on the throne of the khalifat, and whose nominal superiority
was acknowledged by the Asiatic princes in their Friday’s
prayers, the most powerful sovereigns either held their states
in fee, as the vassals of the Sultan Sandjar, or governed them
as his lieutenants. As, in the ancient Persian empire, the
seven satraps of the distant large provinces, surrounded the
throne of the great king as viceroys (like the seven Amshaspande
collected round the throne of Ormusd), so the rulers,
of seven powerful dignities, acknowledged the Sultan Sandjar
as the source of their power; which, indeed, enfeebled by
distance, operated less powerfully on the extreme points of the
circumference, than in the centre.</p>

<p>The Indian provinces of Multan and Gur, immediately to
the south of Khorassan, were governed by the Sultan of
the Gasnewides, Behramshah, and him of the Gurides, Hossein
Jehansus (world burning). Ahmed, the son of Soleiman,
whose frequent rebellions had brought upon him as frequent
punishments, ruled in northern Transoxana; and the adjacent
province of Khowaresm was held in fief by, first, Kotbeddin,
then his son, Itsis, two great court and hereditary dignities,
who likewise held the office of chief cup-bearer. In middle
Persia, reigned the Sultan Mahmud, the Seljukide, under the
guidance of his uncle Sandjar; and in the northern and
western provinces, Aserbijan and Irak, the two dynasties
of the Atabegs, founded by Amadeddin Ben Senji and the
Turcoman Ildigis, acknowledged him as paramount lord. As
the two powerful families of the Gasnewides and Seljukides,
after reigning more than a century, were nodding to their
fall, and the dynasties of the Atabegs were shooting up
into multifarious branches, we think a few words relative
to the origin of the latter not unsuitable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>Atabeg, not <em>Father of the Prince</em>, as it has been translated,
but, <em>Father Prince</em>, or <em>Princely Father</em>, was an honorary title,
first borne by the great Vizier Nisam-ol-mulk, without any
claim to unlimited authority, and still less to be hereditary.
Under the successors of Melekshah, this title distinguished
the highest military dignity of the empire, and was given, at
the court of the Bagdad khalif, to the Emir-ol-umera (i. e.
<em>prince of princes</em>); and at the court of Cairo, to the Emir-ol-juyush,
or <em>prince of the army</em>. But, as at a preceding epoch,
the family Buje had exercised the power of the khalifat,
under the title of Emir-ol-umera, and in the west that of, the
Merovingian race had, under the title of <em>maire du palais</em>,
passed into the hands of the Carlovingians; so the Atabegs
possessed themselves of boundless authority, and raised
themselves into dynasties. The principal are, besides that
of the Atabegs of Irak, that of Aserbijan, that of Fars,
called also the family of Salgar, and that of Loristan; all of
which, in the short space of five years, made their claims
to unlimited rule available.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<p>Within this period, disappeared the reigning families of
Kakuye, in Fars;<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> that of the sons of Togteghin, at Damascus;<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
the family Nedshah, in Yemen;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> and that of the
Gurides in Khorassan;<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> in whose stead arose the Seliki, as
kings of Erzroum, and the Eyoubides, as princes of Emessa;
and, three years before the death of Sandjar, the mightiest
prince of his time, a still more mighty one was born,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Jengis
Khan, the scourge of the east and the west, who afterwards
converted the most fertile territories into a wilderness, and
bathed the deserts with streams of blood.</p>

<p>Cotemporaneously with the last ten years of Salgar’s reign
in the east in Khorassan, Nureddin Mohammed Ben Ama<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>deddin
Sengi, Lord of the Irak Atabegs, ruled in Syria, as
one of the greatest princes of the east. He was a cotemporary
of Salgar, and the most powerful opponent of the
Crusaders; whose historians, unceasingly employed in detailing
the mischief which he caused them, cannot refuse him the
just praise of his great and noble qualities. “Nureddin,” says
the learned William, bishop of Tyre, a man profoundly versed
in history, “was a prudent, discreet man, who feared God
according to the faith of his people; fortunate and an increaser
of his paternal inheritance.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> His budding power sorely oppressed
that of the Christians; whose conquests put a term
and measure to his. Raymond, Prince of Antioch, and Gosselin,
Count of Tripoli, fell as the trophies of his victories;
the first at the siege of Anab,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> on the battle field; the
second, as he was proceeding to the chase, from his residence,
Telbasher,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> was taken prisoner by a foraging party of Turcomans.
The castles of Telbasher, Antab, Asas, Ravendan,
Tellkhaled, Karss, Kafsrud, Meraash, and Nehrelhus,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> fell
into the victors’ hands, with considerable booty.</p>

<p>Nureddin, as possessor of Mossul and Aleppo, was, in
fact, the lord of northern Syria; but in the southern, he still
wanted Damascus as a <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point d’appui</em> for his rule. Here Mejereddin
Abak,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> the last of the Seljukides of Damascus, reigned;
or, rather, with his name and with unlimited power, his vizier,
Moineddin Ennar.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Twice had Nureddin invested it with
his besieging army; at length, the inhabitants, dreading to
fall under the dominion of the Crusaders, summoned him to
their assistance. Mejereddin retired willingly, and received
in exchange, first Emessa, then Balis, and afterwards went to
Bagdad. Nureddin, having obtained Damascus, raised it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>from the ruin caused by an earthquake, and chose it as his
metropolis; adorning it with mosques, academies, libraries,
hospitals, baths, and fountains. As Melekshah, the great
prince of the Seljukides, had been the first to establish a high
school (Medresse) at Bagdad, so Nureddin founded at Damascus,
the first theological school (Darol-hadiss), where the traditions
of the prophet were treated of.</p>

<p>With the constant practice of the two most splendid
oriental princely virtues, liberality and justice, he combined
the strictest attention to the duties of Mohammedanism. Just
and modest, as Omar Ben Abdolasis, the seventh khalif of
the Ommiad family, he was pious and strict, like Omar Ben
Khattab, the second successor of the prophet. He wore
neither silk nor gold, but cotton and linen; and never expended
on his clothes, or nourishment, more than his just lot
of the fifth of the booty. He was ever engaged in the “<em>holy
war</em>;” either the “<em>lesser</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> with weapons in his hand, against
the enemies of Islam; or the “<em>greater</em>,”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> with fasting and
prayer, occupying day and night in political duties and
study.</p>

<p>The presents of foreign princes, he caused immediately to
be sold, and devoted the proceeds to pious institutions, public
buildings, and eleemosynary purposes. Besides presenting
large sums annually, to the inhabitants of the holy cities,
Mecca and Medina, and the Arabs of the desert, to induce
them to allow the caravans of pilgrims to proceed unmolested;
he divided, every month, five thousand ducats among the
poor. He particularly honoured and rewarded jurisconsults,
in whose ranks he was himself inscribed, as he had collected
into a particular work, Fakh-rinuri (i. e. <em>glory of light</em>), the
traditions of the prophet, relating to justice, alms, and the
holy war, as the ground-work of his policy, morals, and
discipline. As, during his long reign of twenty-eight years,
he conquered more than fifty castles, and established in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>the cities of his dominions, mosques and colleges; and had
maintained most gloriously, both less and greater war, for
Islamism; so history gives him, like his father, Amadeddin
Sengi, not only the honorary title Gasi, or victorious, but also
that of Shehid, or martyr; because both merited the crown of
martyrdom, if not in the field of battle, in that of honour,
by their unwearied exercise of princely duties, and martial
virtues.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Religion and policy combined to decide Nureddin in
favour of the khalif of Bagdad, against him of Cairo. His
inclination to do homage to the former, rather than to the
latter, as the successor of the prophet, would find more ready
access to his mind, as on account of the great confusion prevailing
in Egypt, the time seemed to have arrived for the
Atabegs to tear the sceptre from the feeble grasp of the
Fatimites. This long shapeless idea of Syrian policy soon
received form and existence from the Egyptian civil war,
between the two viziers, Dhargham and Shawer, who, under
the last of the Fatimites, struggled for mastery.</p>

<p>In the same year<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> in which Nureddin had, by one of the
most splendid victories, and the conquest of Harem, repaired
the great discomfiture which he had received from the Crusaders,
four months previously, at Bakia (Boquea), Shawer
himself came to Damascus, to promise the third part of the
revenues of Egypt, if Nureddin would aid him with arms,
against his rival, Dhargham. Nureddin sent the governor of
Emessa, Esededdin Shirkuh (i. e. <em>lion of the faith of lion’s
mount</em>), of the family Eyub, with an army into Egypt.
Dhargham fell in battle; Shawer was restored to his former
power, but on refusing to fulfil his promise, the lord of lion’s
mount took possession, with his troops, of the eastern province
Sherkiye, and the chief town Belbeis. Shawer, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>most fickle of viziers, faithless alike to friend and foe, and,
by his false policy, a traitor to his army and himself, called
Amaury, formerly Count of Askalon, then king of Jerusalem,
with the Crusaders, to his assistance, against the general
of his ally; he soon, however, repented, and dismissed the
Crusaders, with a sum of sixty thousand ducats.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Esededdin, being reinforced with fresh
troops, advanced against Cairo, and defeated the khalif at
Ashmunind, and remained master of Upper Egypt, at the same
time that his nephew, Yusuf, took Alexandria, and maintained
himself there valiantly, for three months, against the combined
besieging forces of the Egyptians and the Crusaders.
At the end of this period peace was concluded; Nureddin
receiving, as compensation, an annual sum of fifty thousand
ducats, and the Crusaders, one hundred thousand, out
of the revenues of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> There remained, moreover, at
Cairo, a general of the Crusaders, with some thousands of
men, as a garrison and protection against Nureddin’s enterprises.</p>

<p>These advantages accorded to the king of Jerusalem, in the
metropolis of Egypt, tempted him to a rupture of the peace,
with the hope of becoming master of the whole country.
Persuaded by the knights-hospitallers, whose grand-master
hoped to maintain his order, in the possession of Belbeis,
which, in warlike preparations, he had charged with a debt of
more than one hundred thousand ducats, Amaury advanced
with an army against Egypt. The Templars, however, refused
to participate in the expedition, either from real displeasure
at the rupture of the peace, or, what is more probable, from
jealousy of the knights of St. John, and other hidden grounds
of their mysterious policy.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>In this predicament, Shawer applied to Nureddin, for
assistance against the Crusaders, who had already<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> made an
irruption into Egypt, had taken Belbeis, and were besieging
the capital. New Cairo was surrounded with a wall, at which
women and children laboured with untired zeal, day and
night. The more ancient part of the city, Missr, usually, but
incorrectly, called Old Cairo, was set on fire, by command of
Shawer, and burned for fifty-four days. The Khalif Adhad
despatched couriers with urgent letters to Syria, imploring
the aid and assistance of Nureddin against the infidel; and to
depict the highest grade of his necessity, he enclosed locks of
his wives’ hair, as if to say, “Help! help! the enemy is dragging
our women from us by the hair of their heads.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> Nureddin
was, at that time, at Aleppo, and Esededdin Shirkuh, at Emessa,
his government. Nureddin immediately intrusted him with
the conduct of the Egyptian campaign; and gave him for the
execution of it, two hundred thousand ducats, and a chosen
body of eight thousand men, six thousand of which were
Syrians, and the remainder Turcomans. In the meanwhile,
Shawer and Amaury, both on the brink of despair, entered
into negociations; the latter for the possession, the former for
the relief, of Cairo. Shawer promised, in the name of the
khalif, the enormous sum of a million of ducats, and the king
was glad to receive fifty thousand ready money.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> On this,
the Crusaders retired, when the Syrians, under the conduct of
Esededdin, appeared before Cairo.</p>

<p>The khalif, accompanied by the chief officers of his court,
repaired to the camp, and complained bitterly of the excessive
power of Shawer, who, merely on his own account, had invited
the Franks into the country, committed Missr to the
flames, and desolated the land; and entreated Esededdin Shirkuh
for his vizier’s head, being himself too powerless to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>secure it. The latter soon became aware of the danger which
threatened his life, and resolved to make away with Esededdin,
together with his nephew, and the princes of his court, under
the pretext of an invitation to a banquet. The project was,
however, betrayed; and the intended victim retorted on the
guilty head of Shawer, which was sent to the khalif. Nureddin
immediately stepped into Shawer’s place, as vizier and
Emir-ol-juyush, with the title of Almelek-al-mansur (i. e. <em>the
victorious king</em>); and as he died sixty-five days afterwards,
his nephew, Yusuf Salaheddin (i. e. <em>Joseph, justness of faith</em>),
was invested with the same high dignities of the empire, and
received the honorary designation, Almalek-ennassir (i. e. <em>conquering
king</em>). He was the founder of the dynasty of the
Eyubites; his greatness, like his name, smoothed, and diminished
by the western historians, is more familiar to Europeans,
than that of many other great princes and conquerors
of the east, at whose names and deeds European languages
and manners recoil.</p>

<p>The Syrian heroes of the Crusades have been celebrated
by the Christians in Europe, and the latter by the
former in Asia. Amadeddin Sengi, Nureddin, and Salaheddin,
appear in European chronicles of the Crusades, as Sanguin,
Noradin, and Saladin; while in the Moslem annals, the count
of Tripoli, the prince of Antioch, and the king of Jerusalem,
are masked under the names of Comis, Birias, and Rei. In
the following book, we shall have an opportunity of mentioning
Salaheddin’s exploits more at large; as yet he appears as
the khalif’s vizier, and Nureddin’s general, in whose name he
administered the government of Egypt; he caused the name
of his master the Atabeg, to be mentioned in the public
prayers on Friday, after that of the khalif.</p>

<p>Nureddin thought the opportunity was now arrived to
destroy the khalifat of the Fatimites, and to deprive the last
of them of even the shadow of power. He commanded his
lieutenant, Salaheddin, to fill up all judicial offices, which had
hitherto been held by Imamis or Ismailis, with lawyers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
orthodox sect of the Shafiites, and in the public prayers to
name the Abbaside khalif, Almostanssar-biemrillah, instead of
the Fatimite Adhad-lidinillah. Salaheddin delayed the fulfilment
of these commands, as the people almost universally
were of the sects, Rafedhi and Shii, and still hung to the
phantom of the Fatimite khalifat: the last representative of
that race, however, Adhad-lidinillah, very opportunely falling
sick and dying,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Salaheddin immediately transferred the royal
prerogative of prayer on Friday, from the name of the khalif
of Cairo, to that of the khalif of Bagdad, after whom, Nureddin,
the Atabeg of Syria, was named.</p>

<p>Thus, Salaheddin executed, more, indeed, for his own
than Nureddin’s interest, though still in the latter’s name, the
great stroke, by which the main trunk of the western Ismailites
was overthrown; after having budded for more than two
hundred years, and transplanted itself into Asia, in the branch
of the eastern Ismailites, or Assassins. The throne, which
the secret doctrine of the Ismailites wished to establish on the
ruins of all others, was overturned, and buried the lodge of
Cairo in its ruins. The khalifat of the Abbasides prevailed
over that of the family of Ali, for which the envoys of the
Ismailites preached and intrigued; and the phantom, in whose
name they had deluded the people, vanished from the earth:
an event of great magnitude, and rich in consequences; important
in the history of the east, and more especially in that
of the Assassins, to whom, Salaheddin, whose dominion rose
on the ruins of the Egyptian khalifat, appeared a powerful
and dangerous foe.</p>

<h2>BOOK IV.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Reign of Hassan II., Son of Mohammed, the Son of Busurgomid,
known by the name of Ala-sikrihi-es-selam&mdash;that
is, Hail to his memory&mdash;and his Son, Mohammed II.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>I</big>n</span> the preceding books, we traced the mysteries of irreligion
and immorality up to their source, and stripped the secret
doctrine of the Ismailites of the mask of pretended sanctity,
under which it concealed itself from the eyes of the people.
A doubt may, perhaps, have arisen in the minds of our
readers, whether we have not scrutinized the system of the
order too closely; and whether, as it was constantly kept
secret, it may not have been somewhat slandered by the uninitiated
and its enemies. The effects of the secret doctrine
had, indeed, manifested themselves in the bloody traces of
the dagger; nevertheless, these multiplied horrors might,
perhaps, be attributed to accident, or private feuds, rather
than to a regular system of infidelity and homicide. Even
in our own days, the secret doctrines of many degenerate
orders has been lauded as pure and innocent, although their
results have appeared in the crimes of regicide and rebellion.</p>

<p>The Jesuits and the illuminati, though otherwise opposed
as to their spirit&mdash;the former protecting, the latter undermining,
thrones&mdash;have both been accused of profligate doctrines:
the former, of permitting the killing of popes and kings;
and the latter, of dispensing with thrones and religion. In
the writings of individual members, the maxim may be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
that it is lawful to kill kings, and to strangle the last of them
with the intestines of the last priest: these horrors, however,
were never publicly taught, or acknowledged by the order at
large. The regicide, imputed by Pombal to the Jesuits, and
the poisoning of Ganganelli, have not been sufficiently
proved; and even were this the case, the Jesuits have as
little confessed the guilt of Malagrida, as have the Illuminati
approved of Jean de Brie’s proposition of establishing a
propaganda of Assassins.</p>

<p>As little is the secret doctrine of the Templars convicted
of profligacy, by the confessions wrung from them by the
torture; and if they have been accused of it by cotemporary
writers, others, of later date, have, on the other hand,
defended them.</p>

<p>In this matter, however, the case of the Assassins is very
different from that of the Templars, Jesuits, or Illuminati.
All that has hitherto been said of their secret doctrine of
systematic infidelity and sedition, is by no means founded on
untenable conjectures, historical accusations, or forced confessions;
but on the free acknowledgment of their teachers
and masters; who, after having long concealed the atrocities
of impiety from the eyes of the world, under the mask of
the most profound hypocrisy, on a sudden lifted the veil, and
published, to the profane, the mysteries of atheism and immorality,
hitherto the inheritance of the initiated. This was
a most inconsiderate slip; most destructive to the order, and
entirely adverse to the profound policy of its founder, who
had formed the well-grounded opinion that the edifice of
domination and civil society can be held together only by the
doctrines of faith and duty; that the open abolition of all
religion and morality would necessarily entail the universal
destruction of the existing order of things; and that the
strongest security for blind obedience is to give reins to the
wildness of the passions. Moreover, besides that, by such
a desecration, the secret of the few became the property of
the many, the leaders and their dupes changed parts, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
system of the order caused its own destruction from within:
it also exposed itself, in all its nakedness, to its external
enemies; and, by its own avowal, roused up the world to
vengeance, and justified the anathemas of priests&mdash;the persecution
of kings, and the curses of nations. All this had
been well and thoroughly considered by the son of Sabah;
not so, however, by his namesake, and third successor, Hassan
the Second, the son of Mohammed, the son of Busurgomid.</p>

<p>He had, as we have seen already, during his father’s life,
stood forward, with innovations, as a prophet, and had only
preserved his life from the executioner’s sword by the deepest
dissimulation. As soon, however, as he succeeded to the
grand-mastership, he threw off the burthensome mask, and
not only gave way himself to all possible extravagances, but
also permitted the same license to all others with impunity.
Not content with this, he could not resist the desire to mount
the pulpit himself, as a popular preacher. Had he been as
enlightened as his predecessors in the grand-mastership, and
had the maturity of his judgment kept pace with the riches
of his attainments, he would have forborne to hurl the flaming
brand of infidelity and lawlessness among the people. It
was of small advantage to himself, and still less for the order,
that he was considered learned, and possessed of intellect,
and his father heavy and ignorant.</p>

<p>Preservative ignorance is better than destructive erudition,
and darkness itself is to be preferred to the lurid glare of
a conflagration. Hassan, the son of Mohammed, determined,
at whatever cost, to be an expositor, and to favour the impunity
of vice, not merely by example, but also to preach
from his own mouth the irreprehensibility of crime. In
Ramadan, of the 559th year of the Hegira,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> the inhabitants
of the province of Rudbar were collected, by his orders, at
the castle of Alamut. On the place Mossella (<em>the place of
prayers</em>, situated at the foot of the castle, like the suburbs of
Shiras, celebrated by Hafez),<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> a pulpit was placed, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>towards Kibla (<i>i. e.</i> the country of Mecca), to which the
Moslemim turn in praying, and in the four corners, four different
coloured flags were planted&mdash;a white, a red, a yellow,
and a green.</p>

<p>Oh the seventeenth of Ramadan,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> the people were assembled
on this place: Hassan ascended the pulpit, and commenced
by involving his hearers in error and confusion, by
dark and puzzling expressions. He made them believe that
an envoy of the imam (the phantom of a khalif still tottering
on the Egyptian throne) had come to him, and brought an
epistle, addressed to all Ismailites, by which the fundamental
maxims of the sect were renovated and fortified. He declared
that, according to this letter, the gates of mercy and
grace were open to all who would follow and obey him;
that those were the peculiarly elect; that they should be
freed from all obligations of the law; released from the
burthen of all commands and prohibitions; that he had
brought them now to the day of the resurrection (<i>i. e.</i> the
manifestation of the imam). Upon this, he began to recite, in
Arabic, the khutbe, or prayer, which he pretended to have
just received from the imam. An interpreter, standing at
the foot of the pulpit, translated to the audience in the following
words:&mdash;“Hassan, the son of Mohammed, the son
of Busurgomid, is our khalif, dai, and hudshet (our successor,
missionary, and proof), to whom all who profess our
doctrine are to yield obedience in spiritual, as well as temporal,
affairs; executing his commands, and considering his
words as inspired, and must not transgress his prohibitions,
but observe his behests as our own. Know all, that our
Lord has mercy on them, and has led them to the most high
God.” He then descended from the pulpit, caused tables to
be covered, and commanded the people to break the fast,
and to give themselves up to all kinds of pleasure, to music,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>and play, as on feast days; “for to-day,” said he, “is the
day of the resurrection” (<i>i. e.</i> the revelation of the imam).</p>

<p>From this day, on which crime manifested itself undisguisedly
to the world, the name of Mulahid, or Impious,
which hitherto had been given to the disciples of Karmath,
and other disturbers of social order, by the lawyers, was now
bestowed upon all the Ismailites of Asia in general. The
seventeenth of Ramadan was celebrated with games and
banquets; not only as the feast of the revelation, but also as
the proper epoch of the publication of their doctrine. As the
Moslimin reckoned their time from the flight of the prophet,
so did the Mulahid, or Impious, from the revelation of the
imam (<i>i. e.</i> the 17th Ramadan, in the 559th year of the
Hegira.) And as the name of Mohammed was never mentioned
without the addition of the “Blessed,” so, henceforth,
was added to that of Hassan, the words “Blessed be his
Memory,” which history, instead of blessing, curses. The
historian Mirkhond, tells us, that he had heard from Yusuf-shah
Kiatib, on the authority of credible persons who had
read it, that the following inscription was over the door of
the library in the castle of Alamut:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container2">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i04">“With the help of God,</div>
<div class="line">The ruler of the world</div>
<div class="line">Loosened the bands of the law.</div>
<div class="line">Blessed be his name.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hitherto, the grand-masters had always represented themselves
as only the precursors of the imam, as his missionaries and
envoys, and severe censors of observance of the rules of
Islamism. Hassan, however, now at once asserted that he
was himself the imam, in whose hand all power lay to loosen
the band of the law. By abolishing them he accredited himself
with the blind multitude as lawgiver and khalif.</p>

<p>In this character, he wrote to the presidents and envoys of
the different provinces. His letter of credentials to Reis
Mosaffer, the grand-prior of Kuhistan, as his namesake had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
been in Irak, under the founder, Hassan Sabah, was of the
following tenor: “I, Hassan, tell you that I am God’s vice-gerent
on earth; and mine, in Kuhistan, is the Reis Mosaffer,
whom the men of that province are to obey, and whose words
they are to listen to as mine.” The reis caused a pulpit to
be erected in the castle of Muminabad, the residence of the
grand-prior of Kuhistan, from which he read the letter of the
grand-master to the people. The majority of the inhabitants
heard the perusal with joy. They played the pipe and drum,
danced and drank wine at the foot of the pulpit, and made
known their contempt of law, and their libertinism in every
possible way. Some few, who remained true to the doctrines
of Islamism, emigrated; others, who could not resolve upon this
step, stayed, and shared with the rest the reputation of impiety.</p>

<p>Thus the standard of the freest infidelity and most daring
libertinism floated on all the castles of Rudbar and Kuhistan,
as the insignia of the new doctrine; and instead of the name
of the Egyptian khalif, that of Hassan resounded from all the
pulpits, as that of the true successor of the prophet. Since
prejudices are often more deeply rooted in the breast than
religious rites and moral laws, it was easier for Hassan to
assume the character of legislator than that of imam, whom
the people hitherto only acknowledged in the Egyptian
khalif.</p>

<p>In order to support his pretensions to this title, he at length
found it necessary to deduce his descent in blood from the
Fatimite khalifs; and although he had, in the public assembly
of the 17th Ramadan, called himself the son of Mohammed
Ben Busurgomid, he endeavoured to prove, partly by dark
intimations, partly by ambiguous writings, the opinion that he
was a son of Nesar’s and grandson of the Khalif Mostanssur,
during whose reign the founder, Hassan Ben Sabah, had been
at Cairo, and had, in the political dissensions of the Ismailites,
espoused the party of Mostanssur’s elder son against his
younger brother, Nesar; on which account he had been compelled
by the generalissimo, Bedr Jemali, to quit Egypt, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
have before related more at length. The rumour which his
adherents dispersed abroad in confirmation of his descent was
to this effect. A certain Abulhassan Seide, a confidant of
the Khalif Mostanssur, had come from Egypt to Alamut a year
after his patron’s death, and had brought with him a son of
Nesar’s, whom he confided to the care of Hassan Ben Sabah,
who received the envoy with great respect, and had assigned
to the young imam a village at the foot of the castle as a
residence, where he, after a time, married, and gave his son
the name, “Blessed be his Memory.”</p>

<p>At the same time that the imam’s wife was delivered of
this child, the wife of the grand-master, Mohammed, son of
Busurgomid, was in her accouchement. A confidential female
servant carried the young “Blessed be his Memory” into the
castle, and substituted him in the place of the son of Mohammed.
As this tale was too absurd to meet with easy
credence, and as, according to their pure doctrine, that all was
indifferent and nothing forbidden, the assertors of this genealogy
were not ashamed subsequently to maintain that the
young imam had had clandestine intercourse with Mohammed’s
wife, the fruit of which was the reigning grand-master,
imam, and khalif, Blessed be his Memory. Thus, Hassan preferred
being thought a bastard of the blood of the khalifs, to
being deemed his father’s legitimate child. The honour of the
mother was sacrificed to the ambition of the son; and because
adultery afforded grounds to his pretensions, the sanctity of
the harem was forced to give place to the merit of ambition.</p>

<p>The Ismailites, who, in this manner, made Hassan a descendant
of Nesar, the son of Khalif Mostanssur, were called
Nesari, a name considered synonymous with the Impious or
the Assassins. They gave Hassan the name of Kaimolkiamet
(i. e. <em>Lord of the Resurrection</em>), and called themselves the
sect of the Resurrection or Revelation; for, by the epoch of
the resurrection they understood the time when the one about
to rise (Kaim, i. e. <em>the imam</em>), should bring them near to God
by the removal of all laws. This period had, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
their pernicious opinion, occurred during the imamat of
Hassan, who, on that account, emancipated the people from all
legal obligations. Thus were the bounds of duty and morals
at once and openly violated. Undismayed, and with heads
erect, Vice and Crime stalked over the ruins of Religion
and social order; and Murder, which hitherto had felled
the destined victims under the mask of blind obedience, and
as the executioner of a secret tribunal, now raged in indiscriminate
massacres.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>Hassan, as might have been expected, died a martyr to his
new doctrine. In the fourth year of his licentious reign, he
fell at the castle of Lamsir, by the dagger of his brother-in-law,
a descendant of the family Buyeb. In this murder, the
historian views not so much the visitation of celestial wrath
on so many crimes (which, indeed, both his predecessors and
successors had better merited), as the natural punishment of
insulted prudence, which, in the ordinary course of human
affairs, is sooner or later avenged equally with the greatest
viciousness. It was the height of imprudence in Hassan, the
learned explainer, to surrender the most recondite doctrines
of the order to the many-headed hydra, the people; and he
sealed with his own blood the universally accorded liberty of
murder.</p>

<p><i>Reign of Mohammed II., Son of Hassan II.</i></p>

<p>The conflagration which Hassan had kindled, by the
revelation of the secret doctrine, was not extinguished
by his blood, but, on the contrary, extended its flames
through all Asia during the reign of his son and successor,
Mohammed II. The first act of his government was to
revenge his father’s death; whose murderer, Hassan Nanwer,
together with all his kindred, both male and female,
bled under the executioner’s axe. Instead of profiting by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>this bloody example, to strike into a better road, he constantly
pursued the same path. He preached, even more loudly than
his father, the doctrine of impiety; and, like him, asserted his
rights to the dignity of supreme imam. Deeply versed in
philosophical studies, he considered himself to be in these, as
in other branches of knowledge, alone and unequalled. Many
of his philosophical and legal apothegms have been handed
down by tradition; we shall not, however, cite them in this
history. He did homage by these studies, not only to the
institution of the founder of the order, who, profoundly acquainted
with the mathematical and metaphysical sciences,
had collected books and instruments in his castle of Alamut,
but also to the spirit of the ages in which the civilization of
modern Persia approached the summit of its splendour; and
philosophy as well as poetry were at the epoch of their
greatest glory in that country. Cotemporary with his long
reign of forty-six years (for so long did the clemency of
heaven endure the monster on earth), lived and died a pleiad
of Persian poets, greater and more illustrious than that of the
Alexandrines under the Ptolemies, or that of the French
poets under Francis the First.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>During this period flourished the lyric poets, Suseni<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> and
Watwat,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> of whom the former may be considered the creator
of the metrical system, and the latter as the legislator of
Persian poetry; the two great panegyrists, Khakani<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> and
Sohair Faryabi,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> who, together with their predecessor, Enweri,
stand the great columns of the splendid edifice of oriental
eulogium; the two great mystics, Senayi<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> and Attar,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> the
former writer of the “Ornamental Garden,” Kadikat, which
the well-known author of the “Garden of Roses and Fruit,”
Saadi, seems to have kept in view; the latter the composer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>of the “Dialogues of Birds” (Mantikettair) and other celebrated
works, in whose footsteps trod Jelaleddin Rumi,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> the
great mystic poet of the east; lastly, Nisami, the greatest
romantic poet of the Persians, the immortal bard of Khosru
and Shirin.</p>

<p>Besides this pleiad of poets, other stars of the first magnitude
shone in the hemisphere of juridical and metaphysical
science. The Sheikh Abdolkadir-Ghilani,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> the founder of
one of the most respectable orders of dervises, and whose
monument at Bagdad is, to this day, visited by pilgrims no
less frequently than that of the great Imam Ebu Hanife;
the two great jurists, Ahmed Ibn Mahmud Gasnewi<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> and
Imam Borhaneddin Ali Ben Ebibekr Almaraghainani;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> the
former, author of the “Mokademme” (<em>Prolegomena</em>), the
latter of the “Hedayet” (Guide), two classical works of
practical jurisprudence; the secretary Amad,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> immortal in
the annals of calligraphy; the great historian Ibn Essir
Jeseri,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> the composer of the “Kamil;” and, to conclude, the
philosopher Shehabeddin Sehrwerdi,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> and the Imam Fakhr
Rasi,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> who must not be confounded with their namesakes,
the former with the sheikh, nor the latter with the poet nor
the physician Rhases. Both of them are remarkable, not
only in the history of literature, on account of their opinions,
but also in that of the Assassins, by reason of their fate, as
presenting, both by their lives and their deaths, examples of
the danger which the literati incurred, who either openly reproved
or combatted the doctrines of infidelity.</p>

<p>The former, namely, the philosopher Abufeth-Yahya Ben
Hanosh Ben Emirek, commonly celebrated as Shehabeddin
Sehrwerdi, the writer of several metaphysical works, was put
to death at Aleppo by the son of Salaheddin, by order of his
father, because his doctrines had been condemned by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>College of Jurists as philosophical, or, in other words, as
atheistical, and the shedding his blood was declared to be
lawful. The Imam Fakhreddin Rasi being menaced with the
same fate, escaped it, but not without great danger. During the
grand-mastership of Mohammed II., the son of Hassan II., he
taught jurisprudence publicly in his native city, Rei. Having
been slandered by some who envied his reputation, as being
secretly a disciple of the Ismailitic doctrine, and even one of
their missionaries and envoys, he mounted the pulpit, and in
order to clear himself from the imputation, he abused and
anathematized the Ismailites. As soon as the grand-master
received information of this, through his emissaries, he sent a
Fedavi, or initiated Assassin, to Rei with special instructions.
This man appeared as a student of law, and in that character
visited the imam’s college. Seven months elapsed ere he
found a fitting opportunity of executing his commission. At
length he watched an instant when the imam’s servant was
absent in quest of food, and his master alone in his cabinet.</p>

<p>The Fedavi entered, locked the door, and throwing the
imam to the ground, placed himself with his drawn dagger on
his breast. The imam demanded his purpose. “To tear out
thy heart and bowels!”&mdash;“And wherefore?”&mdash;“Because
thou hast spoken evil of the Ismailites in the public pulpit.”
The imam conjured the Assassin to spare his life, and swore
most solemnly never to slander the Ismailites again. “If I
leave thee,” said the murderer, “thou wilt fall back into
thy old ways, and consider thyself released from thy oath by
artful sophistries.” The imam renounced all explaining
away of the oath, and was willing to abide the penalties of
perjury. “I had no commands to slay thee, or I had not
been wanting in the execution. Mohammed, the son of Hassan,
greets thee, and requests thee to honour him with a visit
at his castle. Thou shalt there receive unbounded power,
and we will obey thee as honest servants. ‘We despise,’
says the grand-master, ‘the rumours of the people, which
glide from our ears like nuts from a globe; but you shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
insult us, because your words are graven as with a graver on
stone.’” The imam replied that he could not go to Alamut,
but that, in future, he would not permit himself to utter a word
against the lord of that fortress. Upon this the Fedavi drew
three hundred pieces of gold from his girdle, which he gave
him, saying, “Behold thy pension; and by a decree of the
divan, thou wilt receive the same sum annually from the Reis
Mosaffer. I also leave thee two dresses of Yemen for thy
servant; these also the grand-master sends thee.” At the
same instant the Fedavi disappeared. The imam took the
dresses and the money, and for four or five years the
same sum was scrupulously paid him. Prior to this occurrence,
he was wont, whenever he mentioned the Ismailites in
a discussion, to express himself thus: “Whatever the Ismailites
(whom may God curse and destroy) may say.”
After he had received the pension, he always said briefly:
“Whatever the Ismailites may say.” He answered one of
his pupils, who asked him the cause of this change: “We
may not curse the Ismailites; their arguments are too convincing
and pointed.”</p>

<p>This singular occurrence, which is related by several Persian
historians,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> circumstantially and concordantly, shows that
the grand-master’s policy did not consider murder only as the
most effective measure, but also frequently deemed the fear
of it, and money, preferable. It shows also that the divan, or
assembly of the order, studied less the removal of their foes
than the converting them into friends, especially where they
were men of learning and celebrity, as their lives being spared
was of far more advantage to the order in public opinion, than
their violent deaths could have been.</p>

<p>With the exception of this anecdote of the Imam Fakhr
Rasi, history mentions little or nothing of what occurred to
the order during the reign of Mohammed, in the Persian
provinces of Jebal and Kuhistan. It is, however, much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>fertile in events of immediate interest in the history of the Assassins,
if we turn our eyes towards Syria, which was, at the
same time, the celebrated stage of the glorious deeds of the
Crusaders and Salaheddin. As this great prince seems to be
chosen as the instrument in the hands of Providence, of the
downfall of the khalifat of the Fatimites, whose partisans and
missionaries the Ismailites were; so was he, likewise, very early
selected by the latter as a mark for their daggers. In order
to become more intimately acquainted with the man whom
they marked out as their victim, and to know to what a pitch
his power had risen when they made the first attempt upon
his life, we shall here give, as a sequel to what has been
said in the former book concerning the reign of Nureddin,
a short outline of the increasing greatness of Salaheddin.</p>

<p>Invested after the death of his uncle, Esededdin Shirkuh,
with the highest dignity in the realm, under the name of
Melek Ennassir, he received from his lord, the Atabeg Nureddin,
a confirmatory diploma, together with the title of
Emir al Isfahlar, which means the same in Persian as the
Arabic Emir al Juyush, that is, Prince of Armies. Shortly
afterwards, the khalif of Bagdad sent him also a diploma,
dress of honour, and present, as an acknowledgement to him
for having transferred the highest prerogative of Islam, the
prayer from the pulpit on Friday, from the family of Fatima
to that of Abbas. At Cairo stood the treasury, in which, for
two centuries, the Fatimites had amassed the wealth of
Moghreb,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Egypt, Syria, and Arabia; its riches, surpassing
all belief, was but too small for the magnanimity of Salaheddin.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
According to Aini, an otherwise trustworthy writer,
there were in this treasury alone, seven hundred pearls, each
of which was, from its great size, of inestimable value; an emerald,
a span long and as thick as the finger; a collection of
2,600,000 books, which, even if there is a superfluous cipher,
surpassed the largest library in Europe; gold, coined and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>in bars; aloes, amber, and arms without end. A considerable
part of this treasure Salaheddin divided immediately among
the chiefs of his army. He appointed guardians to the library;
the remainder of the collection being put for sale for
ten years in succession, produced the sums requisite for the
campaigns against the Crusaders, and for the buildings in Cairo.</p>

<p>He built the citadel and walls of that city, constructed the
large aqueduct which brings the waters of the Nile to the
fortress, and the noble halls, amongst whose beautifully arranged
colonnades, stripped as they are of their roofs, the
writer of this work has, more than once, indulged in airy
visions of Salaheddin’s greatness. Added to these, are an
academy at the tomb of Shafii, an hospital at Cairo the modern,
and a magazine of corn at Missr, the ancient capital of
Egypt under the Arabians. All these architectural works
bear the stamp of their founder’s greatness, and on them is
inscribed his name, Yusuf, which the ignorance of the present
inhabitants of Cairo and Missr confounds with that of the
Egyptian Joseph. Thus, in this case, as with the heroes of
Grecian antiquity, the feats of several great men are united
under one name. The space of centuries, which intervenes
between two landmarks of human greatness, is lost to the
thought of posterity, and the common name becomes the more prominent
as a monument of antiquity on the wide plain of
history. Thus it is with the Egyptian Yusuf, whether he be
the Joseph of ancient history, the minister of Pharoah and
grandson of Abraham, or the Yusuf of modern history, the
lieutenant of Nureddin, Salaheddin, the grandson of Eyub.</p>

<p>Nureddin, indeed, viewed Salaheddin’s increasing greatness
with a jealous eye; and felt that it was no longer in
his power to recall at his pleasure the master of the treasure
of the Fatimites; yet was he politic enough to confirm his
lieutenant, whom he could not remove, and the latter sufficiently
grateful, at least nominally, to acknowledge Nureddin
as his liege lord. As he did not wish to appear in open opposition
to him, and yet, in case of necessity, desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
provide himself with a place of refuge, he undertook the
campaign against Yemen,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> whither he sent his elder brother,
Turanshah, with an army. This region was, at the time,
governed by Abdennebi, son of Mehdi, a disciple of the
impious sect of Karmath, who exhausted the country with
his extortions and oppression. The plundered treasure he
collected at the tomb of his father Mehdi, at Sobeid. The
walls were covered with gold, and likewise the cupola, which
dazzled the eyes at some miles distance. Gold, silver, pearls,
and precious stones were heaped in profusion. Abdennebi
wished to make this tomb the resort of pilgrims, instead of the
kaaba, and for this reason he plundered the caravans going to
Mecca, and added their goods to the accumulated booty of
injustice and rapine.</p>

<p>In the sequel, several princes, and particularly those of
Persia, have, from political motives, attempted to prevent the
pilgrimage to Mecca, and to turn the devotion of the people
rather to other burial places, as Meshed Ali’s, on the Euphrates,
which was also covered with plates of gold by Shah
Abbas; or Meshed Ben Mussa’s, at Tuss, in Khorassan, in
order that, with the caravans, the money may remain in the
country. Mecca, however, retained its superiority as the
true and only shrine of Islamism, which triumphed over the
conquests of the Karmathites and Wahabites; and whose
gates, spite of the wide-spread portals of infidelity and impiety,
remained to the last ever open to the pilgrim. Turanshah
defeated and killed Abdennebi, the protector of unbelief,
razed his father’s monument, and added the treasures to those
of his brother Salaheddin, in Egypt; by command of the
latter he caused prayers to be repeated from the pulpit for
the khalif of Bagdad and Nureddin.</p>

<p>After the death of Nureddin,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> the prayers as well as the
coinage were continued by Salaheddin, in Egypt and Arabia,
in the name of Saleh, a boy of eleven years of age, the son of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>Nureddin, who, himself incapable as yet of governing, was
in the power of his grandees, and particularly of the eunuch
Gumushteghin, who transferred the young prince’s residence
to Aleppo, leaving Ibn al Mokaddem governor of Damascus.
The Crusaders, who desired, after Nureddin’s demise, to avail
themselves of the favourable circumstance of his son’s minority,
threatened Damascus, the siege of which was only raised on
the governor’s disbursing to them large sums of money. Enraged
at this, and being invited by some of the chief men,
Salaheddin repaired in all haste to Damascus with only seven
hundred horse. He reproached the governor with his unworthy
conduct, and wrote to the young atabeg a respectful
letter, in which he did homage to him as his lord, and averred
that he had come into Syria only for his defence, his possessions
being assailed on two sides, by the Crusaders and his
nephew Seifeddin, lord of Mossul. The answer which was
drawn up by his enemies, contained, instead of thanks, accusations
of ingratitude and disobedience, and threats of very
shortly removing him from the vice-royalty of Egypt.</p>

<p>Provoked at this, Salaheddin declared to Nial, the lord of
Manbedj, bearer of the missive, that the inviolability of an ambassador
alone preserved his head, and marched with his troops
to Aleppo, in order, as he said, to have a personal interview
with his young prince. On his way he took Hama and Hemss,
and encamped in the vicinity of Aleppo. The inhabitants and
the young prince, led by his guardian, the eunuch Gumushteghin,
instead of coming to a peaceful conference with Salaheddin,
advanced against him in arms. “God is my witness,” exclaimed
he, “that I wish it not to come to arms! but since
ye will have it so, they shall decide.” The troops of Aleppo
were defeated, and fled in disorder to the city, which their
opponents now began to besiege in due form.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>Gumushteghin, who saw no protection at hand from the
swords of his valiant besiegers, had recourse to the daggers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>of the Assassins. At that period reigned, as grand-prior at
Massiat, the point, as we have seen, of the Syrian power of
the Ismailites, Rashideddin Sinan,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> a man, whose name and
deeds are to this day remembered in their annals.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<p>Massiat lies in the mountain range Semak, which, running
parallel with the coast of the Mediterranean, unites
itself with that of Lebanon.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> This village, with eighteen
others, belongs to the territory of Hama (Epiphania). At
that time it was the chief of ten mountain forts, forming the
strength of the Ismailites, whose numbers are reckoned by
the cotemporary annalists of the Crusaders to amount to
more than sixty thousand men.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The names of these places
are found in Hadji Khalfa’s Geography;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> three have already
been mentioned in this history; namely, Massiat, Kadmus,
and Kahaf; the seven others were, Akkar, Hossnalekiad,
Safita, Alika, Hossnalkarnin, Sihinn, and Sarmin, and were the
first colonies of the Ismailites in Syria.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> By means of these
strongholds, and the daggers of the Assassins, Rashideddin
Sinan was supreme in the mountainous parts of the north of
Syria. Salaheddin, the proper defender of the faith, who
had given the final blow to the Fatimite khalifate in Egypt,
and whose increasing power threatened to ingulph that of the
Atabegs in Syria, was the natural and most dangerous enemy
of the order, and consequently their daggers were unceasingly
aimed against him. A large sum of money contributed to
procure easier access to the grand-prior Sinan, for the prayer
of Gumushteghin, that Salaheddin should be the victim of
their mutual revenge. Three Assassins attacked him in the
camp before Aleppo; fortunately, they inflicted no mortal
wound, and were themselves cut in pieces.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>While the eunuch was concerting Salaheddin’s fall, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>scarcely escaped his own; which his enemies, the vizier
Shehabeddin Abu Saleh, and the emirs Jemaleddin, Shadbakht,
and Mojahid, had conspired to ensure, in order to
deprive him of the favour of Meleksaleh. To anticipate
their purpose, he had recourse to the usual means dictated by
his policy. As the young prince was starting on a hunting
excursion, Gumushteghin presented him with a blank sheet of
paper, desiring his signature for the despatch of some pressing
business. Meleksaleh signed unsuspectingly, and his
minister filled the paper with a letter from his master to
Sinan, the grand-prior of the Assassins, requesting agents
from him, for the purpose of despatching the three emirs
above-mentioned. Sinan, thinking that Meleksaleh wished,
by this deed, to remove some obstacles to his unbounded
power, sent several murderers. Two of them, who attacked
the vizier as he was proceeding to a mosque, lying near his
house, without the eastern gate, were killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Soon after, Mojahid was set upon by three others: one
seized the skirt of his mantle, to stab with more certainty;
but Mojahid spurred his horse, and escaped the fatal blow,
leaving his mantle behind. The people seized the Assassins,
two of whom were accustomed frequently to visit Mojahid’s
groom. One of them was crucified; and the same was
the fate of the groom, on whose breast was fixed the inscription,
“This is the reward of the concealers of villains.” The
other Assassin was dragged to the citadel, and beaten on the
pierced soles of his feet, to compel him to confess the motives
of his crime. In the midst of the torture, he called out to
the young prince: “Thou desirest from our lord Sinan, the
death of thy slaves, and now thou punishest us for the execution
of thy orders.”</p>

<p>Indignant at this, Meleksaleh wrote a letter, full of reproaches,
to Sinan, who returned him one subscribed by
himself as his answer. This was the origin of a kind of
correspondence between them. Rashideddin had frequently
applied to the prince, for the restoration of the district of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Hajira, of which the Ismailites had been deprived. As his
writing had been fruitless, he had recourse, this time, not
from the pen to the dagger, but to the still more destructive
means, fire. The Assassins appeared as incendiaries, who
set fire to several bazaars of Aleppo, with burning naphtha.
All the efforts of the governor and his people to extinguish
the conflagration were fruitless, which being produced by
means similar to the celebrated Greek fire, resisted pertinaciously
the action of water. Many buildings were entirely
consumed, and an immense quantity of rich stuffs and commodities
of all kinds fell a prey to the flames. The Assassins
threw burning naphtha into the streets, from the terraces
of the houses, and, in the midst of the confusion, escaped the
popular rage unhurt.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>Meleksaleh Ismail, Prince of Aleppo, whose favourite,
Gumushteghin, had in vain unsheathed the dagger of the
Assassins against Salaheddin, now sought assistance from the
Crusaders, and his nephew Seifeddin, Lord of Mossul. The
former laid siege to Emessa, but retired on the approach
of Salaheddin; but Seifeddin, and Aseddin, his brother, united
their forces with those of Ismail, at Aleppo. Salaheddin once
more attempted to come to an amicable arrangement with the
latter. He offered him, in a submissive letter, the restoration
of Hama, Hemss, and Baalbek; and stipulated only for the
vice-royalty of Egypt, and the possession of Damascus. His
liberality was deemed weakness. A great battle was fought
at Hama, in which the combined forces of Mossul and Aleppo
were completely routed.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p>From that day forward, he advanced with steady steps in
the path of sovereignty, as he transferred to his own name
the two prerogatives of coinage and prayer, which hitherto had
remained, in Egypt and Syria, in the name of Saleh. The
latter received peaceful possession of Aleppo, only by humble
supplication, and the lord of Mossul, who again took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>field, with those of Hossn Keif and Maradin, lost at Tell,
near Hama, both his camp and army. Salaheddin divided
the booty among his soldiers, set the prisoners free, and took
the fortresses of Asas, Manbedj, and Bosaa.</p>

<p>During the siege he was, a second time, attacked by an
Assassin, who wounded him in the head. Salaheddin seized
his hand in time, and struck him down. Another immediately
rushed forward, but was cut down by the guards; two others
followed with no better success.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Having before their eyes
the example of their three precursors, who had fallen in a
similar attempt, they hoped the better to attain their object
by rushing on successively, and, by throwing the sultan and
his guard into consternation, succeed in taking his life. The
first part of their plan was more successful than the last.
Salaheddin, terrified by these repeated attacks, retired to his
tent, mustered his army, and drove away all strangers.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>The following year,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> however, as soon as he had concluded
a peace with the lords of Mossul and Aleppo, he attacked the
territory of the Ismailites, ravaged it, and blockaded the
fortress, Massiat. He would have carried it, and would have
annihilated the power of the Ismailites in Syria, had not his
uncle, Shehabeddin, Lord of Hama, moved by the entreaties
of the grand-prior, Sinan, interposed, and induced his nephew
to make peace, on condition that he should, in future, be
secured from the Assassin’s dagger; and, in fact, Salaheddin
reigned fifteen years afterwards, carried on his campaigns
in Egypt and Syria, and captured the strongest places of the
Crusaders, even Jerusalem itself, without experiencing another
murderous attack.</p>

<p>Whether it was that the double failure of the Assassins,
restrained them from a third attempt, or that the order considered
it necessary to preserve Salaheddin, the greatest enemy
of the Crusaders, as a counterpoise to the growing power of
the latter; or, lastly, that, contrary to the fundamental maxims
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>of the order, some idea of the sanctity of a treaty floated in
the mind of the grand-prior, though most improbably,&mdash;all the
ties of religion and morality having been loosened, and the
mysteries of impiety publicly divulged by the grand-masters,
Hassan and Mohammed; it nevertheless appears, that Rashideddin
Sinan struck out a path for himself, both in respect of
doctrine and policy; one, too, which varied somewhat from
that of his predecessors, and of the reigning grand-master.
The former, as we have seen above, were the secret friends
of the order of the Templars, the latter trampled on all
religion. Sinan’s faith and policy, however, took another
direction, as is clearly shown in the unanimous accounts of
cotemporary historians of the Crusaders.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>What William, Bishop of Tyre, and James, Bishop of
Acca, on the occasion of an embassy, despatched from the
Old Man of the Mountain to the king of Jerusalem, in the year
1172, relate concerning the origin, system, and discipline of
the Assassins, agrees very well with that which we have
derived from oriental sources, and presented to our readers
in the former books: “The Assassins,” say they, “were formerly
the strictest observers of the laws of Mohammedanism,
till the epoch when a grand-master of genius and erudition,
and intimately acquainted with the Christian tenets, and doctrine
of the Gospel, abolished the prayers of Mohammed,
annulled the fasts, and allowed all, without distinction, to
drink wine and eat pork. The fundamental rule of their
religion, consists in blind submission to their abbot, by which
alone they could attain eternal life. This lord and master,
who is generally called the Old Man, resides in the Persian
province, lying beyond Bagdad (Jebal or Irak-Ajemi). There
(at Alamut) young men are educated in secret tenets and
pleasures, instructed in various languages, and then sent, armed
with their daggers, throughout the world, to murder Christians
and Saracens without distinction; either from hatred, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>being enemies of their order, or to please its friends, or for
the sake of a rich reward. Those, who had sacrificed their
lives in the fulfilment of this duty, were adjudged to greater
happiness in paradise, as being martyrs; their surviving relations
were loaded with gifts, or, if slaves, set at liberty. Thus
was the world overrun by these miserably misled youths, who,
devoted to murder, issued joyfully from their brethren’s convent,
to execute the sanguinary commands they had received;
appearing in different forms and disguises, sometimes as
monks, sometimes as merchants; in fact, in such a variety of
shapes, and with so much prudence and caution, that it was
impossible for the destined victims to escape their daggers.
The low and mean mob of the people are safe, inasmuch as
the Assassins deem it beneath their dignity to assail them;
but for the great, and for princes, no remedy remains but to
ransom their lives at a heavy price; or to be constantly
armed and surrounded by their guards, and exist in a continued
state of alarm.”</p>

<p>On an attentive comparison of these passages, in the
works of the two learned bishops, which agree in point of
meaning, with the narratives of oriental writers, much is
found wanting, but nothing erroneous. The strict observance
of the duties of Islamism at first, the abrogation of all
commandments under the last grand-masters, Hassan II.,
and Mohammed II., the vow of blind obedience, the bands
of Assassins devoted to death, their noviciate, the institution
of the order, and its murderous policy, are here comprised
in a few words. It is, indeed, difficult to conceive
how European historians, who, hitherto, drew from no other
sources than the Byzantine and Crusading annalists, how
such orientalists as D’Herbelot and Deguignes, could have
regarded the Assassins as an usual dynasty of princes;
whereas, here, every thing points to an order, inasmuch as
they clearly speak of the abbot, convent, grand-master, rule
of the order, and religion; as we should concerning the Knights-Hospitallers,
the Teutonic knights, and the Templars. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
thing harmonizes with the contents of the preceding books of
this history: one circumstance only, that of the superior, who
sent the embassy, being inclined to Christianity, and desirous
of conversion, does not agree with the systematic plan of
irreligion of the then reigning grand-master. Either the
Crusaders deceived themselves with the pious error, that because
the grand-master had abjured Islamism, he must assent
to Christianity; or, his policy induced him to preserve the
king of Jerusalem in this opinion, and, consequently, as the
friend of the order; or, lastly, what appears more probable
than either of these conjectures, this mission did not proceed
from the grand-master at Alamut, but from the grand-prior
of the order in Syria, Rashideddin Sinan, Lord of Massiat.</p>

<p>It must have been the latter, and not the former, who
paid the Templars the annual tribute, to effect the removal of
which was the chief object of the embassy; and what gives
our opinion the highest degree of probability, is the contents
of Rashideddin’s writings, which are to this day preserved in
Syria, by the remainder of the Ismailites.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> In them appear
evident traces of Christianity, and of an acquaintance with its
sacred books.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p>Rashideddin Abulhasher Sinan, son of Suleiman of Basra,
pretended that he was himself an incarnation of the Deity.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
He never shewed himself but in coarse dresses of hair; he
was never seen to eat, or drink, or sleep, or spit. From the
top of a rock, he preached to the people, from sunrise to sunset,
and was long considered by his audience as a superior
being. When, however, they discovered that he limped, from
having been wounded by a stone in a great earthquake,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> he
was near losing both the sanctity of his character, and his life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>the people wishing to murder him as an impostor. He exhorted
them to patience, descended from the rock, where he
had preached so long as a Stylite, invited his hearers to a
banquet, and succeeded, by the power of his eloquence, in
inducing them unanimously to swear obedience and fealty
to him as their superior.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> He seized the moment when the
grand-master of the Ismailites in Persia had exposed all the
mysteries, and by that means sapped the foundations of the
order, to envelope himself in the halo of an apostle, and
confirm his dominion in Syria.</p>

<p>For this reason, he is unanimously considered by oriental
historians as the chief of the Ismailitic doctrine in Syria;<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> and
even to this day, his writings are esteemed canonical by the
Ismailites still remaining in that country. They consist of a
shapeless chaos of contradictory articles of faith, which probably
are all to be understood only allegorically; a host of
mutilated passages from the Koran and the Gospels, hymns,
litanies, sermons, prayers, and ritual ordinances. These can
hardly have been preserved in their original purity, but must
have descended to us intermixed with the superstition and
ignorance of later centuries, like the books of the Druses,
who, now as little acquainted as the Ismailites with the spirit
of their founder, possess but a very imperfect knowledge of
their original dogmas, and have lost the tradition of the allegorical
doctrine.</p>

<p>It was Rashideddin Sinan, therefore, the grand-prior of
Massiat, and not the cotemporary grand-master of Alamut,
who sent, in the latter years of the reign of Amaury, King of
Jerusalem, the envoy Behaeddewlet, a skilful, prudent, and
eloquent man, with the secret offer, that he and his followers
would undergo baptism, providing the Templars, their nearest
neighbours on the mountains, would release them from the
annual sum of two thousand ducats, and live in brotherly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>peaceful union with them. King Amaury received the envoy
with joy, promised to pay the Templars, out of his own purse,
the two thousand ducats from which they begged to be released,
and sent him, after keeping him for some time, back
with guides and an escort, as far as the Ismailite confines.
They had already crossed the territory of Tripoli, and had,
therefore, arrived in the vicinity of their first castles, which
are situated on the mountains in the environs of Tortossa, or
Antoradus, when suddenly a body of Templars rushed from
an ambuscade, and killed the envoy.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>Thus, these knights, who were suspected of being secretly
allied to the Ismailites, and followers of their doctrine, openly
proclaimed themselves likewise as Assassins: the religion of
both had a bond of union in the guilt of wilful murder. The
actor of this tragedy was Walter de Dumesnil, a vicious, one-eyed
man; who, however, did not perform this act of atrocity
from motives of private malice, but with the knowledge of
the brethren, and by the command of the grand-master, Odo
de St. Amand, and to avenge the order. The inducement
seems to have been no other, than the Assassins having endeavoured
to relieve themselves from the annual tribute of two
thousand ducats to the Templars, either to purchase peace
with the neighbours, or for the recompense of services performed:
as, for example, as is mentioned in its place, their
refusal to participate in the campaign against the Egyptian
sultan, their natural protector.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>The king, violently enraged at this atrocity, by which the
honour of the Christian name, and his own dignity, suffered
so severe a blow, assembled the princes of his realm, in order
to consult with them, concerning the measures proper to be
adopted. Their unanimous decision was, that religion, and
the royal authority, had equally suffered an affront, and could
not permit this murder to pass unpunished. Seiher, of Mamedun,
and Gottschalk, of Turholdt, were despatched by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>council, in the name of the king and the realm, to demand
satisfaction from Odo de St. Amand, for so flagitious a deed.
Odo, haughty and wicked, fearing neither God nor man,
replied, bursting with arrogance and rage,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> that he had
already imposed a penance on Brother Dumesnil, and should
send him to the holy father, by whom it was forbidden to lay
violent hands on him; and more in the same strain, suggested
by his passion. But the king, meeting the grand-master and
several Templars afterwards, at Sidon, held a council, and had
the murderer, as guilty of high treason, dragged from their
hospital, and thrown, fettered, into a dungeon at Tyre.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> The
death of the king, which followed soon after, saved him from
well-merited punishment.</p>

<p>The grand-master, however, met with his, by being taken
prisoner by Salaheddin, in the battle of Sidon,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> the loss of
which was attributed to his fault, and dying, the same year,
unpitied in his dungeon. The king, indeed, seemed absolved
in the eyes of the Assassins; but the hope of converting them
to Christianity was gone; and their daggers were now again
unsheathed against the princes of the Crusaders, as they had
already long been against the chiefs of the Moslimin. Forty-two
years had elapsed, since they stabbed Raymond, the
young Count of Tripoli,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> as he was kneeling at prayer, and
stained the altar with his blood. This long truce of the
dagger, with the Christian chieftains, was at once raised by
the atrocious murder of Conrad, Lord of Tyre and Marquess
of Montferrat. Richard, King of England, is accused, both
in European and Asiatic histories, of having been the accomplice,
or instigator of this action, by means of the daggers of
the Assassins.</p>

<p>It is with a reluctant pen that we indicate the circumstances
and motives of this crime, which attaches to the splendid
reputation of one of the first heroes of the Crusaders, a stain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>which neither his military glory, nor forged documents, can
obliterate from the sight of an impartial writer. The pretended
letter of the Old Man of the Mountain, composed by
Richard’s partisans, to acquit him of the guilt of this murder,
stands rather as a proof against him, since it has been proved
to be a manifest invention and forgery.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> This letter commences
with an oath in the name of the law, and ends by
being dated according to the era of the Seleucidæ, both
entirely strange and unknown to the Ismailites; for, at this
time, they publicly trampled on the law, and had substituted,
for the chronology of the Hegira (which besides is the only one
used in the countries of Islamism), that from the accession of
Hassan II.; making it the epoch of the abrogation of the
law. The writer’s making the Old Man of the Mountain date
from Massiat, proves, in fact, nothing, either for or against
Richard; but it rather heightens the probability of the opinion
we have advanced, that the Crusaders were not aware of the
existence of the distant grand-master at Alamut, but considered
the grand-prior of Massiat, as the Old Man of the
Mountain to a certainty. According to the purport of this
apocryphal work of partiality for the hero, this so much celebrated
murder was only an instance of the order’s revenge;
the marquess having pillaged, and put to death, a brother, who
was shipwrecked at Tyre; and instead of giving the order’s
envoy the required satisfaction, threatening to throw him into
the sea. From that time, the death of the marquess was
determined on; and executed, at Tyre, by two brothers, in
the presence of the whole people.</p>

<p>All that is true in this Latin production of Nicolas of
Treveth, which was either written by himself, and accepted as
credible by Richard’s party, consists in the circumstances of
the murder. The marquess was attacked by two Assassins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>disguised as monks,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> who had approached him unobserved, in
the market-place of Tyre. Not only do western, but also
oriental historians, name Richard Cœur de Lion, King of England,
as the instigator of the murderers. Alberic des Troisfontaines
expressly affirms it,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> but with those who doubt, the
contradiction of Nicolas of Treveth might be equiponderant
to his charges, if the scale did not turn against Richard, with
the heavy weight of the impartial testimony of oriental historians.
The writer of the history of Jerusalem and Hebron,
a classical work for the history of the Crusades, says, under
the title of the murder of the marquess, clearly and distinctly:
“The marquess had gone, on the 13th of the month Rebi-ul-ewel,
to visit the bishop of Tyre; on coming out, he
was attacked by two murderers, who stabbed him with their
daggers. Being seized, and put to the torture, they confessed
that they were employed by the king of England. They
were put to death with torments.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>The same work contains still farther traits of Richard’s
craft and perfidy, which stain his character but too deeply,
and justify but too much the suspicion of his being accessory
to this murder. Thus, his imprisonment by Leopold of
Austria, a near relation of the marquess of Tyre, seems to
have been but a measure of reprisal, for the death of his
kinsman.</p>

<p>While the English, to remove from their monarch the
suspicion of this assassination, and to liberate him the sooner
from his captivity, forged the above-mentioned letter<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> of the
Old Man of the Mountain, to Leopold of Austria; they, at the
same time, and with the same view, concocted a second, which
is mentioned by William of Newbury, as having been sent by
the grand-master to Philip Augustus, King of France. This
letter, like the first, bears the marks of a counterfeit on its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>front.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The grand-master of the Assassins is made to call
himself “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">simplicitas nostra</em>;” which we cannot allow our simplicity
to err so far as to believe. In this palpably apocryphal
writing, the Old Man of the Mountain assures the king of
France, that it had never entered into his thoughts to send to
France, at the desire of Richard, Assassins with regicidal
designs.</p>

<p>This letter, the falsehood of which is still more manifest
than that of the former one, proves, instead of acquitting
Richard, that the murder of the marquess of Montferrat had
drawn upon him the suspicion of a similar attempt against the
king of France. Rigord,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> the historian of Philip Augustus,
relates, that while the king was in Pontoise, in the year 1192,
being apprised by letters from Palestine, that Richard meditated
his assassination, he established, for his security, a
body-guard, armed with iron maces; and William Quiart,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
who, a century after, wrote a rhyming history, openly ascribes
the whole murderous system of the Assassins to the king of
England, who had young men educated in the principles of
blind obedience to his cruel commands, in order to sacrifice
the king of France; upon which, the latter instituted his
guard of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergens à masses</em>. Even if these precautions were
groundless and exaggerated, they, nevertheless, were occasioned
by the known deeds and character of Richard. The
murder of Conrad of Montferrat, thus gave rise to the
English king’s captivity in Austria; and, likewise, to the
institution of the first royal body-guard in France.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, appear a thankless and vain labour, to
wish to justify the order of the Assassins, who are charged
with a thousand manifest murders, from the guilt of the
thousand and first; but the duty of impartiality imposes this
task on the historian who remains faithful to truth, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>it may neither acquit, nor condemn. Whether the order, in the
person of Philip Augustus, attempted the life of one prince
more or less&mdash;whether the grand-master directed the poniards
of the murderers, who slew the marquess of Montferrat,
moved by private revenge, or by the desire of Richard, is of
little consequence; participation in murder does not lessen
the guilt of the crime.</p>

<p>We shall not, therefore, stop to inquire whether the Arab
Assassin, found in the camp of Frederic Barbarossa, at the
siege of Milan, in the year 1158,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> and against whom the
emperor received timely warning, came from Spain or Syria;
whether he was in the pay of the pope, or the grand-master
of the Ismailites; or, whether Frederic was destined to fall a
victim to the Old Man of the Mountain, or to him of the seven
hills. He was, on account of his campaigns in Palestine and
Italy,&mdash;his enterprises against the infidels and the papal chair,
equally dreaded by the supreme pontiffs, both of Bagdad and
Rome; and the khalif on the Tigris, would have had no less
cause to rejoice at his death, than the khalif on the Tiber.</p>

<p>He, however, who profits by the commission of an atrocity,
is not always to be accused of being its author. Barbarossa’s
grandson, Frederic II., was accused by Pope Innocent
IV., in the synod of Lyons,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> of having employed Assassins to
murder the duke of Bavaria, and was excommunicated; while
Frederic, in a letter to the king of Bohemia, charges the duke
of Austria with having entertained similar designs against
himself.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> These accusations, however, do not prove the guilt
of the accused, but only the crime of the Assassins.</p>

<p>Two years after<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> the death of Conrad, Marquess of Montferrat
and Tyre, and that of Rashideddin Sinan, Henry, Count
of Champagne, passed, on his journey to Armenia, near the
territory of the Assassins; the grand-prior, the successor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>Rashideddin Sinan, sent deputies to welcome him, and to
invite him to visit his fortress on his return. The count
accepted the invitation, and came; the grand-prior hastened
to meet him, and received him with great honours. He took
him to several castles and fortresses, and brought him at last
to one having very lofty turrets. On each look-out stood
two guards, dressed in white, consequently initiated in the
secret doctrines. The grand-prior told the count that these
men obeyed him better than the Christians did their princes;
and, giving a signal, two of them instantly threw themselves
from the top of the tower, and were dashed to pieces at its
foot. “If you desire it,” said the grand-prior to the astonished
count, “all my whites shall throw themselves down
from the battlements in the same way.” The latter declined,
and confessed, that he could not calculate upon such obedience
in his servants.</p>

<p>After staying some time at the castle, he was, at his
departure, loaded with presents; and the grand-prior told
him, on taking leave, that by means of these faithful servants,
he removed the enemies of the order.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> By this horrible
example of blind submission, the prior showed that he trod
exactly in the footsteps of the founder of the order, who had
given the ambassador of Melekshah a similar proof of the
devotion of his faithful followers.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> Jelaleddin Melekshah,
Sultan of the Seljuks, having sent an ambassador to him, to
require his obedience and fealty, the son of Sabah called into
his presence several of his initiated. Beckoning to one of
them, he said, “Kill thyself!” and he instantly stabbed himself;
to another, “Throw thyself down from the rampart!”&mdash;the
next instant he lay a mutilated corpse in the moat. On
this, the grand-master turning to the envoy, who was unnerved
by terror, said, “In this way am I obeyed by seventy thousand
faithful subjects. Be that my answer to thy master.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>As the historians of the east, as well as those of the Crusaders,
agree in their relation, we cannot, except with regard
to the extravagant amount of seventy thousand Assassins,
(stated by William, Bishop of Tyre, at sixty thousand, and James,
Bishop of Acca, at forty thousand, in which number must be included
not only the initiated, but also the profane subjects of
the order), raise a tenable doubt concerning the truth of the
event, any more than with respect to the noviciate and discipline
of the catechumens of murder, of whom, the Venetian
traveller, Marco Polo, was the first<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> to give accounts, discredited
in his time, and doubted, even lately, by men of
eminence. Since, however, this narrative has been found to
agree in every point with oriental sources,<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Marco Polo’s
relation receives new authority; and after his veracity, like
that of Herodotus, has been doubted by the sceptical for
centuries, the fidelity of the father of ancient history, and of
the father of modern travels, shines, from day to day, with a
still brighter lustre, from the unanimous testimony of eastern
writers.</p>

<p>In the centre of the Persian, as well as of the Assyrian,
territory of the Assassins, that is to say, both at Alamut and
Massiat, were situated, in a space surrounded by walls,
splendid gardens,&mdash;true eastern paradises. There were flower
beds, and thickets of fruit trees, intersected by canals; shady
walks, and verdant glades, where the sparkling stream bubbled
at every step; bowers of roses, and vineyards; luxurious
halls, and porcelain kiosks, adorned with Persian carpets and
Grecian stuffs; where drinking-vessels of gold, silver, and
crystal, glittered on trays of the same costly materials;
charming maidens and handsome boys, black-eyed and
seductive as the houris and boys of Mohammed’s paradise,
soft as the cushions on which they reposed, and intoxicating
as the wine which they presented. The music of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>harp was mingled with the songs of the birds, and the melodious
tones of the songstress, harmonized with the murmur of
the brooks. Every thing breathed pleasure, rapture, and
sensuality.</p>

<p>A youth, who was deemed worthy, by his strength and
resolution, to be initiated into the Assassin service, was invited
to the table and conversation of the grand-master, or
grand-prior: he was then intoxicated with henbane<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> (<em>hashishe</em>),
and carried into the garden, which, on awakening, he believed
to be in Paradise: every thing around him, the houris in particular,
contributed to confirm his delusion. After he had
experienced as much of the pleasures of Paradise, which the
prophet has promised to the blessed, as his strength would
admit, after quaffing enervating delight from the eyes of the
houris, and intoxicating wine from the glittering goblets, he
sunk into the lethargy produced by debility and the opiate;
on awakening from which, after a few hours, he again found
himself by the side of his superior. The latter endeavoured
to convince him, that corporeally he had not left his side, but
that spiritually he had been wrapped into Paradise, and
had then enjoyed a foretaste of the bliss which awaits the
faithful, who devote their lives to the service of the faith, and
the obedience of their chiefs. Thus did these infatuated
youths blindly dedicate themselves as the tools of murder,
and eagerly sought an opportunity to sacrifice their terrestrial,
in order to become the partakers of eternal, life. What
Mohammed had promised in the Koran to the Moslimin, but
which to many might appear a fine dream and empty promises,
they had enjoyed in reality; and the joys of heaven animated
them to deeds worthy of hell. This imposture could not
remain undiscovered; and the fourth grand-master, after
unveiling all the mysteries of impiety to the people, probably
revealed also to them the joys of Paradise, which could, besides,
have but little charms for them, to whom already every thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>was permitted on earth. That which hitherto had served as a
means to produce pleasure, became now itself an object; and
the effects of the intoxication of opium, were the earnests of
celestial delight, which they wanted strength to enjoy.</p>

<p>To this day, Constantinople and Cairo show what an incredible
charm opium with henbane exerts on the drowsy
indolence of the Turk, and the fiery imagination of the Arab;
and explains the fury with which those youths sought the
enjoyment of these rich pastiles (<em>hashishe</em>), and the confidence
produced in them, that they are able to undertake
anything or everything. From the use of these pastiles,
they were called <em>Hashishin</em> (herb-eaters),<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> which, in the mouths
of Greeks and Crusaders, has been transformed into the word
Assassin; and, as synonymous with murder, has immortalized
the history of the order in all the languages of Europe.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> retributive and avenging Fury proceeds with steady
step through the domain of history, but the traces of her
silent progress are not always visible to the eye of man.
Generations have passed away, and empires sunk in ruin,
without its being possible, satisfactorily to point out the
remote and proximate causes of their fall. The judgment
of the conscientious historian stands, then, in the middle
point, between blind scepticism on the one hand, and rash
credulity on the other. He avoids the explaining of events
as an officious interpreter of Providence, no less than
wishing to behold in their progress, nothing but the concatenation
of blind necessity. On the other hand, incidents
emerge, from time to time, from the ocean of history, under
the same circumstances and forms, and in which it is as
impossible not to perceive the hand of heaven, as it is to
overlook the operation of submarine fire in the formation of
a new island. As in the extensive department of acoustics,
different nations have appropriated different sounds to one
and the same object, and have expressed it by different
words,&mdash;hence, the variety of languages; so, in the many-toned
domain of history, one and the same occurrence has
been passed unnoticed by many nations, and, by many others,
viewed and represented in different lights. Hence the
variety of histories, according to the difference of the characters
and genius of countries and nations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>The universally opposed <em>polarity</em>, if we may so express it,
of the east and the west, appears even in the different mode
of writing history. Some events are related by European,
some by oriental writers, and when they coincide, the same
occurrence is viewed in an entirely different light. What
escapes the one is seized by the other, and the latter considers
attentively what the other passes over. How very
different are the judgments of eastern and western historians,
concerning the original condition of mankind, the rise of
kingdoms, the institution of religions, the developement of
civilization, the horrors of despotism, the struggles of liberty,
and the continued connexion of causes and effects! Where
the one views immutable necessity, the other perceives very
often blind chance; and what is deemed by the latter the
consequence of a present crime, appears to the former the
punishment of one long past. This, however, is not the
place to proceed farther with these remarks; yet we have an
opportunity of advantageously applying them to the next
event which we shall have to consider.</p>

<p>The people of the east have the highest notions of the
sanctity of filial duty and paternal authority; to them the
patriarchal is the exemplar of the most perfect government.
Though the violations of filial piety, and the crimes of unnatural
sons, are punished in the west as in the east, and
though parricides in no region escape the vengeance of
heaven, yet it is only oriental historians who inculcate the
experimental truth, that the curse of infanticide follows, in
the same family, parricide; and that the first murdered father
is avenged by the dagger of his grandson.</p>

<p>To the disgrace of mankind, such sanguinary examples
are exhibited in the histories of the ancient Persian kings,
and of the khalifs: how could they be wanting in the
history of the Assassins? Khosru Parwis and the Khalif
Mostanssur, who were stained with their fathers’ blood, died
by the hands of their sons. The resistance which Hassan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the Enlightener, opposed to his father, was avenged on his
son, Mohammed, by his grandson, Jelaleddin; first, by similar
refractoriness, and then, it appears, by poison.</p>

<p>Jelaleddin Hassan, the son of Mohammed, and grandson
of Hassan, was born in the 552d year of the Hegira, had
attained the age of twenty-five years, ere he assumed the
helm of affairs, and had, therefore, had sufficient time, during
the long reign, or rather anarchy, to make salutary reflections
on the pernicious consequences of his enlightening, and the
abrogation of all ties of morality, proceeding from it. Discontented
with the innovation, which had made public to the
people and the profane, the secret doctrine of the founder
and the initiated, he openly, during his father’s life, declared
himself against it, and, by that means, drew upon himself
clouds of the darkest suspicion. The father feared the son,
and the son the father; and their mutual dread was justified
by the sanguinary examples of their predecessors.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s father, Hassan II., had fallen by the poniard
of one of his nearest relations; and Hassan I. had put to
death his two sons. Father and son regarded each other
reciprocally as murderers: on the days of public audience,
when the latter appeared at court, the former wore a coat of
mail under his clothes, and strengthened the guard; but
where the dagger can find no entrance, poison may; and, in
fact, as several historians affirm, Mohammed is said to have
died from the effects of poison. Jelaleddin Hassan, the
third of that name among the grand-masters of the order,
stood forward as the restorer of the true religion, according
to the strictest principles of Islamism. He prohibited every
thing that his father and grandfather had declared to be allowed;
commanded the erection of mosques, the re-establishment
of the call to prayers, and the solemn assembly on
Fridays. He called round him imams, readers of the Koran,
preachers, scribes, and professors, whom he loaded with
presents and favours, and appointed to the newly-built
mosques, convents and schools.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>He sent circulars, not only to the grand-priors in Syria<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>
and Kuhistan, by which he enjoined the re-establishment of
Islamism among the Ismailites, but also to the contemporary
princes, to make known to them his adhesion to the true religion.
He sent ambassadors to Nassir-ledinillah, the khalif of
Bagdad; to the sultan of Transoxana, Mohammed Khowaresmshah;
and other Persian potentates, to assure them of
the purity of his faith. The khalif, the sultan, and the
princes, who considered this declaration to be sincere, received
the envoys with distinction, clothed them in pelisses
of honour, gave them re-credentials, and, for the first time,
designated their lord by the titles proper to reigning princes,
and which, hitherto, none of the preceding grand-masters
could assume. The imams, and great scribes of the time,
issued formal declarations, in which they attested the sincerity
of his conversion, and the orthodoxy of his tenets; and
gave him the honorary tide of Nev Musulman, or New Musulman.</p>

<p>As the inhabitants of Kaswin, who had hitherto lived in
the greatest hostility to the Ismailites, doubted the sincerity
of Jelaleddin’s religious opinions, in order to remove these
doubts, he went still farther: he requested them to send
some persons of respectability to Alamut, who should
have ocular demonstration of the truth. They appeared, and
Hassan III., in their presence, burnt a number of books,
which, he affirmed, were those of the founder, Hassan I.,
and the secret rules of the order. He anathematized the
founder and the grand-masters, his predecessors, and thus
attained his object; which was, that the inhabitants of Kaswin
might, likewise, vouch for the orthodoxy of his doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>In the second year of Jelaleddin Hassan’s reign, his
harem, that is to say, his mother and his wife, undertook,
with great pomp, the pilgrimage to Mecca. During the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>progress, a standard was carried in front, according to the
custom of orthodox princes, and water was distributed to the
pilgrims. To lodge travellers, to afford them every facility
and convenience, to feed the hungry and give drink to the
thirsty, to nurse the sick and to instruct the ignorant; such
are the most meritorious of good works. Hence, were
founded karavanserais, bridges, and baths; eating-houses
and fountains, hospitals and schools, the finest monuments
of Islamism, form, in the circuit of cities and mosques, so
many pious institutions. Many of these may be founded by
persons of either sex, and even by eunuchs, who belong to
neither.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on the mosques and other buildings,
transmit to posterity the names of sultans and sultanas,
viziers and eunuchs, and women of every rank and age.
Although the latter are excluded from no public institution,
on account of sex, and build bridges and schools as well as
found hospitals and taverns, yet their names are found in
preference on mosques, baths, and fountains; probably, because
prayer and bathing are two favourite female occupations;
and because, in the east, they have nowhere an
opportunity of meeting in public, except at the mosque, the
bath, and the well. According to the laws of Islamism, also,
ablution by water is as inseparable from the prescribed
prayers, five times in the day, as purity and devotion from the
existence of woman: baths and fountains, therefore, are a
necessary assistance to the entrance to the mosque of the
female sex, who are naturally so devout. Wells, at which
water is distributed gratis to the passers-by, have a still
closer relation to the piety of Ismailitic women, as is indicated
by their name, Sebil.</p>

<p>Sebil, in Arabic, “the way,” means generally the road,
and the traveller is hence called <em>Ibn-es-sebil</em>, the son of the
road; but it more particularly signifies the way of piety and
good works, which leads to Paradise. Whatever meritorious
work the Moslem undertakes, he does, <em>Fi sebil Allah</em>, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
way of God, or for the love of God; and the most meritorious
which he can undertake is the holy war, or the fight for his
faith and his country, <em>on God’s way</em>.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> But, since pious
women can have no immediate share in the contest, every
thing which they can contribute to the nursing of the wounded,
and the refreshment of the exhausted, is imputed to them as
equally meritorious, as if they had fought themselves. The
distribution of water to the exhausted and wounded warriors,
is the highest female merit in the holy war on God’s way.</p>

<p>War is the first of the good works commanded by God;
after it comes the pilgrimage, the difficulties of which, in the
burning deserts of Arabia, are an image of those of a real
campaign; and after the support of the warrior, that of the
pilgrim, is the finest virtue in a beneficent woman. Hence,
the distribution of water (<em>sebil</em>) to the caravans, the making
of wells and aqueducts on the way to Mecca, have ever been
a splendid object of the piety and ambition of Mohammedan
princesses, from Zobeide, the wife of the Khalif Harun
Rashid, down to the Ottoman sultanas. Jelaleddin’s wife’s
distribution of water surpassed even that of the wife of
Khowaresmshah, the powerful sovereign of Transoxana;
and the Khalif Nassir-ledinillah, gave Jelaleddin’s standard
the precedence of that of Khowaresmshah, which circumstance
afforded the first motive to the great dissensions and
earnest contest between the khalif and the shah of
Khowaresm.</p>

<p>The latter advanced with no less than three hundred
thousand men against the “<em>City of Salvation</em>.” The khalif
sent the celebrated Sheikh Shehabeddin Sehewerdi as ambassador
to the enemy’s camp; this learned envoy commenced a
long and flowery oration, in praise of the family of Abbas,
and the reigning khalif. Khowaresmshah, on the signification
of the speech being communicated to him, replied, “’Tis well!
he, who, as successor of the prophet, and clothed in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>mantle commands the faithful, should possess such properties,
but none of them are to be found in the descendants of the
family of Abbas.”</p>

<p>The sheikh returned without attaining his object, and Khowaresmshah
advanced with his armament as far as Hamadan
and Holwan, when a sudden drifting snow-storm checked his
farther progress, and compelled him to retreat. As he was
preparing for his second expedition against Bagdad, his army
was overthrown on the confines of Kashgar, by the hordes of
Jengis Khan. When Khowaresmshah’s son and successor,
Alaeddin Tekesh, in execution of his father’s plan against
Bagdad, had advanced as far as Hamadan, a twenty days’
snow-storm stopped him in his march.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Winter, and the
Mongols, who rushed like snow-flakes from the north,
for that time preserved the khalif city from destruction; a
destruction destined afterwards to befal it at the hands of
the latter. Jelaleddin, who saw no means of withstanding
the approaching storm, secretly sent ambassadors to Jengis
Khan, to offer him, as well as to the khalif, his homage and
submission.</p>

<p>In this manner, the chieftain of the Ismailites, attained not
only the reputation of unsullied orthodoxy, but also the actual
rank of a sovereign prince, which the khalif had constantly
refused preceding grand-masters. He supported his increasing
credit by amicable relations and alliances with the
neighbouring princes; and, in particular, maintained a good
understanding with his nearest neighbour, the Atabeg Mosafereddin,
the lord of Aran and Aserbijan. They combined against
Nassireddin Mangeli, the governor of Irak, who had declared
war against the atabeg, and invaded the territory of the
Ismailites. Jelaleddin went from Alamut to Aserbijan, where
he was received by the atabeg with great splendour, and
loaded with presents. His army likewise experienced the
liberality of the atabeg in the amplest manner: a thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>dinars were carried, every day, to Jelaleddin’s residence, for
the maintenance of his kitchen only.</p>

<p>The two allied princes sent ambassadors to Bagdad,
desiring the khalif’s aid against the governor of Irak. Nassir-ledinillah
sent several of his most distinguished men with
full powers. Encouraged by this embassy, and reinforced
with subsidiary troops, they advanced against Irak, defeated
and killed the governor, Nassireddin Mangeli, and appointed
another in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> After an absence of eighteen months,
Jelaleddin returned to his fortress of Alamut. As, during his
journey and campaigns, he had everywhere proclaimed his
abhorrence of the system of his ancestors, and had corroborated
his declaration by his prudent conduct, the chiefs
of Islamism universally met him with kindness and friendship.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>He was desirous of cementing his alliance by a closer
family union with the princes and viceroys of Khilan: they,
however, replied, that, without the khalif’s consent, they could
not comply with his wishes. Jelaleddin sent an ambassador
to Bagdad, and Nassir-ledinillah granted his viceroys permission
to ally themselves with Jelaleddin: he received in marriage
the daughter of Keikawus, who bore him his successor,
Alaeddin Mohammed.</p>

<p>In order not to confound this Keikawus, viceroy of
Khilan, with his namesake, the Prince of Ruyan, of the
family Kawpara (which might the more easily occur, as both
have been hitherto unknown to European historians), we
have purposely omitted to speak of the latter, who had
already, half a century before, entered into political relations
with the Ismailites, his next neighbours. We shall now
embrace, at one view, the fifty years’ contemporaneity of the
grand-masters of the Assassins, and the princes of the house
of Kawpara, or Dabuye. It is, however, necessary to pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>mise
a few words, concerning the geographical position of
the northern neighbours of the Ismailites.</p>

<p>The mountain range, which bounds the Persian Irak
Jebal on the north, is, as it were, the bulwark of Persia,
against the Caspian Sea. The partly flat, and partly hilly
country, lying between it and the northern declivity of this
chain, is divided into four provinces; so that two of them
are situated immediately at the foot of the mountains, and
the other two lie between the former and the sea coast.
Dilem and Thaberistan are to the south, and on the declivity
of the mountains; the former to the west, the latter to the
east; beyond them lie Gilan and Mazanderan; the former
to the north of Dilem, the latter of Thaberistan. This
quadruply-divided territory is bounded on the north by the
Caspian Sea, and on the south by the above-mentioned
mountains, on the southern side of which the domain of the
Ismailites extended from Alamut, the seat of government,
south-easterly, to Komis and Kuhistan.</p>

<p>Almost in the centre of these four provinces, beyond the
Caspian Alps, which maps distinguish with precision, lies the
unnoticed district of Ruyan and Rostemdar, ruled by its
native princes, whose family maintained its stand, uninterruptedly,
for eight centuries; while in Gilan, Dilem, Thaberistan,
and Mazanderan, dynasties rose and fell. As the
territory of Ruyan and Rostemdar lie immediately on one side
of Mount Demawend and Alamut, and its subordinate places
on the other, these rulers of Rostemdar demand our attention,
as the nearest neighbours of the Assassins, and, after them,
the lords of Mazanderan, as the most powerful of this pentarchy.
Both these ruling families, and the country over
which they held sway, possess, besides the interest attaching
to them, as being connected with the history of the Assassins,
one more peculiar, and hitherto unnoticed in European histories;
one which arises from the antiquity of their origin,
and the exceedingly ancient monuments of the Persian empire,
still existing in these provinces. In the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
ancient Persian monarchy, the family of Hanefshah reigned
in Thaberistan and Mazanderan, till Korad, the father of
Nushirvan, transferred the government of this country to
his eldest son, Keyuss. Keyuss revolted against his brother
Nushirvan, who had ascended the throne of Persia, and
succumbed to his arms. One of his descendants, called
Bawend, successfully re-asserted the rights of his predecessors,
in the 45th year of the Hegira; and the family
Bawend, of the blood of Nushirvan, although twice interrupted
by the Dilemides and Alides, reigned for a period of
seven hundred years, until, after their third fall, the dynasty
Jelawi arose on their ruin.</p>

<p>No less venerable than this race of the lords of Mazanderan,
to whom, likewise, Kuhistan owed obedience, was that
of the family Dabuye, or Kawpara, which reigned, uninterruptedly,
from the 40th year of the Hegira, when Baduspan
possessed himself of the sovereignty of Ruyan and Rostemdar;
to the 888th, when the family Keyumers supplied their
place. Baduspan was a descendant of that blacksmith, so
famous in the history of the east, Kawe by name, who overthrew
the tyrant Sohak, and hoisted his leathern apron for a
flag; which, adorned with pearls and jewels, glittered till the
end of the monarchy, as the national standard. Feridun, the
legitimate heir, whose right to the throne the magnanimous
smith proclaimed, was not only born in this province, in the
village Weregi, the oldest place in Thaberistan, but also secretly
educated there, during the reign of the tyrant.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<p>His mother had taken refuge there, and had fed the child
with the milk of a buffalo-cow (<em>Kaw</em>, <em>cow</em>), the head of which,
sculptured on Feridun’s mace, has become no less celebrated
among the national insignia, than the leathern apron. It was,
then, from the mountains of Thaberistan, that the young hero
commenced the fight for freedom, which the smith (Kawe)
maintained in the capital. Sohak was made prisoner near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>Babylon, and confined in the village of Weregi, at the foot of
Demawend, whence freedom issued, and where tyranny expired.
Feridun divided his kingdom among his three sons,
Iredj, Turan, and Salem, and retired into his native land,
to Temishe Kuti; which, according to the Shah Nameh,
formed a triangle with the cities, Sari and Kurgan, the ancient
Astrabad. Iredj having fallen in a contest with his
brothers, his son Menutshehr, excited by his grandfather Feridun,
undertook to avenge him. The bones of the three
brothers repose at Sari, under an edifice of stone, which has
resisted the efforts of centuries, and of thousands of men, who
have endeavoured to destroy it.</p>

<p>The plains and glens of Thaberistan were the scene of the
splendid battles of Menutshehr and Afrasiab, when Iran resisted
the irruption of Turan: the whole country is, in fact,
as may be perceived from this cursory topographical notice,
the classic ground of ancient Persian history. Besides the
descendants of Nushirvan’s brother, and of the liberator,
Feridun, and the families of Bawend and Kawpara, whose
origin mounts to the highest Persian antiquity, that of Keyumers,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>
which reigned from the fall of the Kawpara, to the
foundation of the empire of the Sefi, trace their descent from
the king of the same name, who appears so darkly through
the remote clouds of historical traditions, that many writers
actually confound the first Persian king with the first man.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this family is, as far as we know, the last
which has traced its origin, authentically, to the ancient
Persian kings. Chance has, in the conformity of the names
of the first and last sovereign, repeated the play of words,
which appears in history, in the fall of several great kingdoms.
The first and last rulers of the eastern and western Roman
empires, of the Seljukides, of the governors of Thaberistan, of
the prophets of the Moslimin, and of the last of his successors
of the family of Abbas, had similar names. The names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>Augustus, Constantine, Mohammed, Togrul, Keyumers, commence
and terminate the series of Roman, Byzantine, Arabian,
Seljukian, and Persian royal families; and, perhaps, the European
Turkish empire will end, as it began, with an Othman.</p>

<p>After this glance at the great interest, which the country
immediately bordering on the Ismailitic territory, to the north,
presents to the lover of oriental history, both in a topographical
and historical point of view, we shall again direct our
attention to the rulers of Ruyan and Rostemdar, who, together,
are called, Astandar. Astan means mountain, in the
language of Thaberistan, a language entirely unknown in Europe;
and Astandar, ruler of the mountains, is equivalent to
the appellation, Sheikh-al-jebal, or the Old Man of the
Mountain; that is, the grand-master of the Assassins. The
latter shared this title, derived from the character of his territory,
not only with the families of Kawpara, but also with
that of Bawend, who ruled over Mazanderan, and, before the
Ismailites, over Kuhistan; and also with the chiefs of the
highlands beyond Demawend. Astan, Jebal, Kuh, are Thaberistanish,
Arabic, and Persian words, signifying mountain.
The sovereigns of the family Kawpara, called themselves Astandar,
or Prince of the Mountains, as the grand-master of
the Assassins, swaying the sceptre on the other side, was
named Sheikh-al-jebal, Old Man of the Mountain.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>Astandar Keikawus Ben Hesarasf reigned in the first half
of the sixth century of the Hegira, at Ruyan, on the one side
of the Alps, while, on the other, flourished, as lord of the
mountain, at Alamut, Mohammed, son of Busurgomid, grand-master
of the Assassins. The innate hostility, existing between
the Ismailites and all legitimate governments, was still
more increased, by the natural jealousy of proximity, and by
the friendly alliance between Keikawus and Shah Gazi,
Prince of Thaberistan. The latter was one of the greatest
and most implacable enemies of the Assassins, whose hatred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>against those foes of government and faith, was spurred on
by motives of personal revenge. The Assassins had murdered,
as he was coming out of the bath, at Sarkhos, the shah’s
favourite, an exceedingly handsome youth, whom he had sent
with a thousand cavalry to the court of Sandjar. Shah Gasi
buried him with great pomp, near the tomb of the Imam Ali
Mussa, and erected a vaulted chapel over his grave, richly
endowed with the lands of the surrounding villages.</p>

<p>From this moment he never paused in the persecution of
the murderers, who, after bereaving him of what was dearer
than life itself, threatened to deprive him of that also. His
general, Shelku, made a nocturnal incursion into the Ismailitic
territory, and immolated with the sword, many thousands of
the “initiated to the dagger,” and erected, in Rudbar, five
towers formed of their skulls. Shah Gasi sent first against
them, his brother-in-law, the prince of Dilem, Kia Busurgomid,
of the same name as the then grand-master of the
Assassins; and, after his death, the prince of Ruyan. Thus
were irreconciliably opposed to each other, Kia Busurgomid,
of Dilem, against Kia Busurgomid, of Alamut; the highland
chieftain of one side of the Alps, to the Old Man of the
other.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p>When Keikawus, after the death of his nephew, Kia Busurgomid,
of Dilem, united the government of that province
with the lordship of Ruyan and Rostemdar, Shah Gasi, of
Thaberistan, remitted the sum of thirty thousand dinars,
which Dilemistan paid, as tribute to his treasury; but on
condition, that he should maintain a continued war against
the order of the Assassins. The effect of this was, that, at
that period, they dared not show themselves anywhere in
Ruyan, Mazanderan, and Dilem, and that the Moslimin of
those provinces were safe from their daggers. Keikawus
undertook some expeditions against Alamut itself, and plundered
and ravaged the surrounding country. He wrote a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>letter to the grand-master Kia Mohammed, in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“May the life of the infidel, the wicked, the accursed,
the base, the reprobate, be extirpated from the face of the
earth; may the Almighty God annihilate his house, and the
angel of torment prepare his dwelling in hell! God, the
most high, has not in vain commanded to the faithful and the
pious, the destruction of the infidel and the atheist. The
greatest grace and highest favour of the Almighty, is shown
in this; that the flaming sword of perdition is waving over
your heads and country; that ye, having recourse to empty
arrogance and senseless cunning, hemmed in on all sides, are
now like the hunted fox, lost in the brake. What hinders ye
now from showing your manhood, against us, who sit publicly
every where, without chamberlains or door-keepers, guard or
officers? against me, your greatest foe on God’s earth?”</p>

<p>The grand-master replied in the style of the order, laconically,
and cutting as their stilettoes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We have read thy letter; the contents are insults, and
insult recoils on the insulter.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>The successor of Keikawus, Astandar Hasarasf, son of
Shehrnush, struck into an entirely different line of policy.
Weary of the war against the Assassins, he concluded a treaty
of peace and amity, resigned his strongest castles to them, and
even abandoned himself to the extravagances of drunkenness.</p>

<p>Two of the grandees of his court, whom he had injured
by killing the favourite of one, and the brother of the other,
fled to Erdeshir, King of Mazanderan; they complained that
their prince, allied with the Assassins, even trod in their steps;
and represented that, if the king should suffer this to proceed
unresented, the murderers would soon spread themselves
through Mazanderan, and cause universal desolation. Erdeshir
entered into the spirit of this representation, retained the
complainants at his court, and despatched a person of dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>tinction
to Hasarasf, to admonish him to more reasonable
conduct. The admonition being ineffectual, his nobles deserted
him, and fled to Erdeshir’s court; others took up arms
against him, supported by Erdeshir with an army. Hasarasf,
thus abandoned, went over to the Assassins, with whom he
sought refuge.</p>

<p>Shah Erdeshir appointed the Seid Eddai Ilulhaki Aburisa,
governor of Dilem. In a nocturnal attack, executed by
Hasarasf, supported by the Ismailites, the seid was slain; and
Shah Erdeshir swore that he would not rest, till he had revenged
the murder of the seid, with the death of Hasarasf:
the latter fled to the strong castle, Welidj. Erdeshir took
Nur and Nadju, and besieged Welidj for a considerable
time; finding, however, the investment of it too difficult, he
retreated, and appointed Hesbereddin Khurshid, viceroy of
Ruyan and Rostemdar, in place of Hasarasf. The latter
went into Irak, and thence to Hamadan, where he sought protection
from Togrul, the last sultan of the Persian line of the
Seljukides.</p>

<p>Togrul sent an ambassador to Erdeshir, to intercede for
Hasarasf; the shah of Mazanderan replied: “If Hasarasf
wishes to regain the sovereignty of Ruyan, let him do penance
for his impiety, and break off his connexion with the Assassins;
or the sultan may point out another place, where he
may be beyond the alliance of the order of murderers.” The
Seljukide sultan approved of the decision of the king of Mazanderan.
Hasarasf fled to Rei, where he sought the hand
of the daughter of Serajeddin Kamil, and aid from his father-in-law.
Being unable to effect his purpose, he went straight
with his brother, to Shah Erdeshir, who wished to confine him
to the castle of Welidj. The commandant, who had formerly
served under Hasarasf, refused to imprison his former lord;
at length, however, Hasarasf terminated his unquiet life, being
murdered by Hesbereddin, unknown to Erdeshir.</p>

<p>The shah caused his infant son to be brought up, but ere
he attained his majority and the government of Ruyan, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
fell by the hand of one Bistun, who pretended to the
sovereignty. The murderer fled to Alamut, which had ever
been the safest asylum for such criminals. The grand-master
immediately offered to deliver him up, if Erdeshir would, in
return, surrender the village of Herdjan to the order. Erdeshir
would not consent, but replied to the envoy, “What
is a wretch like Bistun, that I should yield one of my
possessions to the Assassins for him?” This happened
in the 610th year of the Hejira, that is, in the third of the
re-establishment of Islamism, by the grand-master, Nev
Musulman, who, on offering to give up the murderer, remained,
indeed, true to his newly-adopted system of restoring
religion, yet at the same time made this measure of policy
subordinate to the interest of the order.</p>

<p>Although no murder stains the history of Jelaleddin’s
reign, and so far his conduct was in full accordance with his
system, the historian is, nevertheless, compelled not only to
question the purity of his motives, but also the sincerity of his
return to the doctrines of Islamism. Two circumstances place
this in a very suspicious light. In the first place, the just
mentioned refusal to deliver up the murderer, who had sought
within the walls of Alamut, the usual sanctuary of impiety,
unless in return for the cession of a village; secondly, in the
burning of the books, when Jelaleddin pretended to celebrate
an <em>auto da fe</em>, of the works and rubrics of former grand-masters,
in order to convince the deputies from Kaswin of the
truth of his conversion. In this, however, it is probable that
he consumed the works of the dogmatists and fathers of
Islamism, while the great library of free-thinking and immorality,
together with the metaphysical and theological works
of Hassan Sabah, the founder, were preserved, though secretly,
and only, as we shall see below, devoted to the flames
on the fall of Alamut and dissolution of the order.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, more than probable, that Jelaleddin’s conversion
of the Ismailites to Islamism, so loudly proclaimed
abroad, and his public abjuration of the doctrine of impiety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
was nothing else than hypocrisy and deeply designed policy,
in order to re-establish the credit of the order, which had been
exposed to the anathemas of priests, and the ban of princes,
by the inconsiderate publication of their doctrines, and to
gain for himself the title of prince, instead of the dignity of
grand-master. Thus the Jesuits, when they were threatened
with expulsion by the parliament, and with a bull of dissolution
from the Vatican,&mdash;when, on all sides, the voices of cabinets
and countries rose against the principles of their morals and
policy,&mdash;denied their doctrine of lawful rebellion and regicide,
which had been imprudently hinted at by some of their
casuists, and openly condemned the maxims which they,
nevertheless, secretly observed as the true rules of the order.</p>

<p>This assertion of a purer moral system and genuine Christianity,
availed little in reinstating in the possession of their
former greatness and power, the once unmasked and exposed
order of the Jesuits; and equally small success had the Assassins,
in regaining their preceding influence and authority,
by this system of proselytism, which was preached from every
pulpit. The twelve years’ reign of Jelaleddin was too short
to efface from the minds of the people the traces of a system
which had lasted fifty years. Under his son and successor,
the Ismailites sank anew into their old habits of impiety and
crime, by which they and their forefathers have been the
abhorrence of the world and the outcasts of mankind. Poison
had put an end to the bloody reign of Mohammed II. the
predecessor and father of Jelaleddin; it likewise accelerated
the accession of his son, and successor, Alaeddin Mohammed
III., a boy of nine years of age. The poisoned goblet, which
had supplied the place of the poniard, was now replaced
by it. The dagger raged unceasingly, by order of the boy,
among his own relatives, who were accused as accomplices in
the poisoning of his father. According to the doctrine of the
Ismailites, the imam, even though a youth, is always considered
as having attained his majority, and the efficiency of
his commands is neither enfeebled by the age of childhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
nor the childishness of age. His orders require unlimited
obedience, as emanating from the higher power, centered in
the vice-gerent of the Deity, and the Ismailites blindly followed
the deadly behests of the young prince, by which their
hands, for twelve years unused to the dagger, again became
accustomed to it.</p>

<p><i>Reign of Alaeddin Mohammed III., Son of Jelaleddin Hassan
Nev Musulman.</i></p>

<p>Although, in the warm climate of Arabia and Persia,
human nature arrives sooner at maturity, and the intellect
sooner attains the freedom of independence, than in the colder
region of Europe, we can more easily conceive a maiden of
nine to be marriageable, than a boy of the same age to be
capable of governing. It appears more natural that Aishe
should, at the age of nine, have become the bride of the prophet
Mohammed, than that his namesake should, at the same age,
have assumed the throne of the Assassin sovereignty. If this
is not surprising, still less is it so that the boy, scarcely emancipated
from the care of the harem, should surrender to it
both himself, and the administration of affairs. The women
governed, and Alaeddin amused himself with feeding sheep,
while the Assassins, as heretofore, raged as wolves in the
folds of Islamism. All the wise ordinances, which Jelaleddin,
the new Musulman, had instituted for the advantage of religion
and morality, were abolished by Alaeddin, the new
infidel. Atheism and licentiousness again raised their heads,
and the dagger was once more red with the blood of virtue
and merit. In the fifth year of his reign, Alaeddin, having
bled himself without the knowledge of his physician, an excessive
loss of blood threw him into a deep depression and
melancholy, from which he never recovered. From that
time, no one ventured to propose to him any remedies, either
for himself, or the disorders of his government. Whoever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
spoke anything in the least displeasing to him, concerning
political affairs, received torture or death for his answer;
thus every thing was concealed from him, whether domestic
or foreign, and he was without any friends or advisers, who
could venture to lay representations before him. The evil
increased beyond all measure; the finances, the army, the administration,
sunk into the fathomless abyss of utter ruin.</p>

<p>Alaeddin, nevertheless, treated the Sheikh Jemaleddin
Ghili with great reverence; he was entirely devoted to him,
and sent him an annual pension of five hundred dinars, on
which the sheikh lived, although he enjoyed besides a gratuity
from the prince of Farsistan. The inhabitants of
Kaswin reproached him for distributing the latter, and
living on the money of the impious; the sheikh replied,
“The imams declare the executions of the Ismailites and the
confiscation of their goods to be lawful; how much more
lawful, then, is it, to make use of the money and goods which
they give of their own accord!” Alaeddin, to whose ears,
probably, this talk of the Kaswiners came, affirmed that he
spared them only on the sheikh’s account; and that if Jemaleddin
Ghili did not reside there, he would fill sacks with
the earth of Kaswin, and hang them on the necks of its inhabitants,
and drive them to Alamut. He ordered a messenger,
who gave him a letter of the sheikh’s once when he was intoxicated,
to receive a hundred blows of the bastinado, and
said to him, “Thoughtless and foolish man that thou wert, for
giving me a letter of the sheikh’s when I was intoxicated;
thou shouldst have waited till I had come from the bath,
and recovered my senses.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Besides the sheikh, Alaeddin held
in considerable estimation the great mathematician, Nassireddin,
of Tus, who had been sent as a hostage to Alamut, by
Mohammed Motashem Nassireddin, to whom he had dedicated
his celebrated work, Akhlaki Nasseri (<cite>the Ethics of
Nassir</cite>). He, as we shall soon see, as prime minister of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>Alaeddin’s successor, supported, for a time, the tottering
edifice of the Ismailitic rule; it fell, however, at last, affording
to the world a remarkable proof, of what talents and a thirst
for revenge, are able to effect in the maintenance, and overthrow
of thrones.</p>

<p>During the reign of this weak prince, there took place the
following negotiation with Sultan Jelaleddin Mankberni, the
last of the sultans of Khowaresm, according to the relation of
an eye-witness. On his return from India, he had appointed
the Emir Orkhan, governor of Nishabur, immediately bordering
on the possessions of the Ismailites.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> Orkhan’s lieutenant,
in his absence, ravaged, by bloody and repeated attacks,
the territories of Tim and Kain, the capitals of Kuhistan and
the principal seat of the Assassins. One of the latter, Kemaleddin,
came as ambassador, to request the suspension of
hostilities; Orkhan’s lieutenant, however, deigned to give no
other answer than the silent but emphatical one, of drawing
several daggers from his girdle, and throwing them on the
ground, before the envoy, signifying, either that he wished
to show his contempt for the daggers of the Assassins, or that
he would have him to understand that he would meet dagger
with dagger. This hieroglyphical style of embassy is a chief
feature in the diplomacy of the east, which not only speaks
to women in the language of flowers, but also to princes, by
images and symbols rather than words. The most ingenious
messages of this kind mentioned by eastern writers,
are those which passed between Alexander and the Indian
king, Porus, who endeavoured to surpass each other
in subtilty and vaunting. They terminated in Alexander’s
sending for a cock to pick up the corn which was shaken
from a sack before him: intimating that though the hosts
of the Indians should be as numerous as the grains of corn,
the Greeks, as brave as game cocks, would soon swallow
them up. A companion to this hieroglyphic of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>cock, is afforded in that of the dead hen, which Alexander is
said to have sent to Darius, concerning the claim of the tribute
of golden eggs or besana (beisa, meaning an egg), to explain to
him, that the hen which had laid these golden eggs was dead.
These, and similar hieroglyphical embassies, were as little
effectual in settling the quarrel between Darius and Alexander,
as they were in the case of the Ismailites, who resolved to
procure for themselves that satisfaction which had been
denied them.</p>

<p>While Sultan Mankberni was residing at Kendja,<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Orkhan
was attacked without the city walls by three Assassins, and
killed on the spot; they then, with their bloody daggers in
their hands, entered the city, and shouted the name of the
grand-master, Alaeddin: they thus proclaimed the power
and sovereignty of their superior in a manner most befitting
a combination of homicides, namely, by blood and unsheathed
poniards. They sought the vizier, Sherfal-mulk (<em>nobility of
the kingdom</em>), in the divan of his house, but not finding him
there, he being with the sultan, they wounded one of his
servants, as a token of their visit; they ran through the
streets of the city, and declared themselves to be Assassins, in
which capacity, they had already, at the grand vizier’s residence,
left dagger wounds instead of a visiting card; their
insolence, however, did not go, this time, unpunished; the
people crowded together, and put them to death with a
shower of stones.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, an Ismailite envoy, Bedreddin Ahmed
by name, having travelled as far as Barlekan, on his way
from Alamut to the sultan’s court, on being informed of the
above occurrence, inquired of Sherfal-mulk, the vizier, whether
he should continue his journey forwards, or return; the
vizier, knowing the enterprising vigour of the Assassins, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>dreading the fate of Orkhan, answered that he might come
in all security; and on his arrival, the vizier applied all his
energies to the satisfaction of his demands, which were the
suspension of the ravages of the Ismailite territory, and the
cession of the fortress of Damaghan. The vizier succeeded
in having the first point promised, and the second was
allowed, in a solemn instrument, in consideration of the annual
sum of thirty thousand pieces of gold. The sultan
departed on a journey to Aserbijan, and the envoy remained
as the vizier’s guest.</p>

<p>At a grand banquet, the wine having already mounted to
their heads, the envoy said to his host, that, in the immediate
retinue of the sultan, among his guards, marshals, and
pages, there were several Ismailis. The vizier, curious to
become acquainted with these dangerous unknown, entreated
the ambassador to produce them, and gave him his handkerchief
as a pledge that no harm should befal him. Immediately
five of the most confidential of his chamberlains stepped
forward as disguised Assassins.</p>

<p>“On such a day, at such an hour,” said one of them, an
Indian, to the vizier, “I could have murdered thee with impunity,
and unobserved; and, if I did not, it was merely from
the want of my superior’s command.”</p>

<p>The vizier terrified, and apparently naturally timid, and
still more so when intoxicated, stripped off his clothes,
threw himself, in his shirt, at the feet of the five murderers,
conjuring them, by their own lives, to spare his; and protesting,
that he would be a more faithful slave of the grand-master,
Alaeddin, than of the Sultan Mankberni.</p>

<p>The sultan, on hearing of the cowardly baseness of his
vizier, sent him an angry message, with the command to burn
the five Ismailites alive. Sherfal-mulk would gladly have
avoided the execution of this command; at length, he reluctantly
obeyed, and caused the five Assassins to be thrown
on the pile, in the flames of which they deemed themselves
happy, in being the sacrifice of their master, Alaeddin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Kemaleddin, the superintendent of the pages, whose duty it
was, more than that of any other officer of the court, to watch
over the immediate retinue of the sultan, was condemned to
death, for admitting Assassins among the pages. The sultan
then departed for Irak, and the vizier remained in the province
of Aserbijan, and with him the relater of this occurrence,
Abulfatah Nissawi. While they were staying at
Berdaa, Salaheddin came from Alamut, as ambassador of the
grand-master, who, being admitted to an audience of the
vizier, spoke as follows:&mdash;“Thou hast sacrificed five Ismailis
to the flames; to ransom thy life, pay for each of these unhappy
men the sum of ten thousand pieces of gold.”</p>

<p>The vizier, confounded by the message, treated the envoy
with distinction, and then commanded his secretary, Abulfatah
Nissawi, to prepare a deed in due form, by which he
bound himself to pay the Ismailis the annual sum of ten
thousand ducats, in addition to the thirty thousand due from
them to the sultan’s treasury. At so dear a rate did emirs
and viziers purchase a respite of their lives from the daggers
of the Assassins, which were constantly pointed against
their breasts.</p>

<p>Alaeddin could seek counsel from the Sheikh Jemaleddin,
and the astronomer, Nassireddin, in spiritual and temporal
affairs, in objects of politics and science; but neither of them
could afford him a remedy for his diseased brain and mental
malady. To find a skilful physician, he applied by embassies
to the Lord of Farsistan, the Atabeg Mosafareddin Ebubekr,
who endeavoured to gratify him, from the natural dread of
the dagger, common to all the princes of the time, and which
made them incline to fulfil the wishes of the prince of the
Ismailites.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> He despatched the Imam Behaeddin, son of
Siaeddin Elgarsuni, one of the first physicians, distinguished
alike by his theoretical science and his practical art; who
employed his attainments, not without some success, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>cure of Alaeddin. When the latter was somewhat better, he
could never obtain license to return. For this once, it was
not the death of the sick, but of the convalescent, that released
the physician. Alaeddin died, not from the consequences
of his early loss of blood, but from the usual remedy
of the order,&mdash;assassination.</p>

<p>Ambition, and the fear of not attaining the supreme
power till late, or not at all, was the cause of his murder, as
it had been of similar preceding ones. Alaeddin had several
sons, and had declared the eldest of them, Rokneddin, while
yet a child, his successor. As he grew in years, he was honoured
as their superior, by the Ismailites, who made no difference
between his commands and those of his father. Alaeddin,
irritated by this premature obedience,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> declared that the
right of succession was transferred to another of his sons; but
the Ismailites paid no attention to this declaration, in accordance
with the received maxim of their sect, that the first declaration
is always the true one, and that with it the business
ends. Our readers may recollect a similar example, in the
history of the Egyptian khalif, Mostanssur, mentioned in the
second book, who first declared his son Nisar, and afterwards,
being compelled by the Emir-ol-juyush, his younger son,
Mosteali, as his successor; whence arose the great schism of
the Ismailites, some adopting the side of Nisar, and others
that of Mosteali.</p>

<p>Hassan Sabah, the founder of the Assassins, who was at
that time in Egypt, was obliged to quit the country, as he
belonged to the former; and much the more natural was the
prepossession of the Ismailites, which, in the spirit of their
founder, decided in favour of the first declaration. Rokneddin,
fearing for his life, which was threatened by his father,
resolved to retire from the court, and to wait in some strong
castle for the moment which should call him to the government.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>
<p>The same year, Alaeddin afforded likewise matter of suspicion
to several of his grandees, and occasion to look after
their personal safety. They concealed their well-grounded
fears, under the mask of the most fawning adulation, and
conspired with Rokneddin against Alaeddin’s life, in order to
secure their own. Hassan of Masenderan, no Ismailite, but
a Musulman, but who stained his faith by a disgraceful connexion
with Alaeddin, was selected by them to be the murderer;
and as he was the instrument of Alaeddin’s unnatural
lust, to be the instrument of his unnatural death. They
watched the opportunity when Alaeddin lay, as usual, intoxicated
among his sheep and shepherds. In order to devote
himself to this pleasure, he had built a wooden house near his
flocks; and while he was sunk in sleep, Hassan of Masenderan,
by command of Rokneddin, shot him through the neck
with an arrow. The murderer received the proper reward:
he and his children were put to death, and their bodies burnt.
The planner of the murder was tortured, if not by the stings
of conscience, by the reproaches of his mother, until the vengeance
of heaven reached him also.</p>

<p>Thus Alaeddin, whose father had been poisoned by his
nearest relation, was murdered by an Assassin employed by
his son; and the horror of parricide revenged parricide. Thus
we come back upon the remark so frequently repeated by
oriental historians, and noticed by us in the commencement
of this book, that parricide begets parricide; as though
heaven would proclaim the atrocity of the crime, by the horror
of the punishment; as if an unnatural son were the only
fitting executioner of an unnatural son, and the terrible alone
could revenge the terrible.</p>

<p>If a double parricide stain the annals of other dynasties,
nature and terror stop with the second, lest, by a long enchainment
of horrors, and a series of parricides, our belief in
humanity, and in the most sacred feelings, should expire.
The history of the Assassins alone, in heaping atrocity on
atrocity, surpasses hell itself; we see four murders in suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>cession,
by near relations, criminally and horribly avenged by
near relations. From Hassan, the Illuminator, to the fall of
the order, the blood of the grand-masters dropped, from step
to step, down to the last: two of them died by the hands of
their sons; two by those of their nearest relatives: poison
and the dagger prepared the grave which the order had
opened for so many.</p>

<p>Hassan fell by the dagger of his brother-in-law, and his
wicked son, Mohammed: the latter, aiming at the life of his
son, Jelaleddin, was anticipated by him with poison; which
murder was again revenged by poison, by his nearest relative.
Alaeddin, son of Jelaleddin, had the mixer of the
poison put to death, and was himself murdered, by his own
son’s command. The place of the ruby goblet of Jemshid,
and the sparkling sword of Rustam, the royal insignia of the
ancient Persian kings, was supplied with the Assassins, by
the envenomed cup and polished dagger. The grand-masters
directed it to the hearts of their enemies, without being able
to turn it from their own. Their guards, the devoted to
death, were common murderers. Hell reserved for the
grand-masters themselves the privilege of parricide.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>BOOK VI.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Reign of Rokneddin Kharshah, the last Grand-master of the
Assassins.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>T</big>he</span> crimes of the society of murderers, which had long ago
exceeded the measure of humanity, had, at length, filled to
overflowing that of retributive vengeance: after an existence
of a hundred and seventy years, the tempest of destruction
fell, with terrific fury, on the Assassins. The conquering
power of Jengis Khan, thundering in the distance, had passed
innocuously over their heads; but under the third of his successors,
Mangu Khan, the whirlwind of Mongols swept over
the eastern world, and, in its desolating progress, carried
away, along with the khalifat, and other dynasties, that of the
Assassins. In the year 582 of the Hegira,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> when the seven
planets were in conjunction, in the sign Libra, as they had
been, a century before, in that of Pisces,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> all Asia was trembling,
in expectation of the end of the world, which astrologers
had declared was to happen, the first time by a deluge, and
the second by hurricanes and earthquakes. But if, the first
time, a swollen mountain torrent drowned only a few pilgrims,
in order not to put the prophecy to the blush; and the
second, there was so little wind on the appointed night, that
lights burnt freely in the open air, on the top of the minarets,
without being extinguished; nevertheless, at both periods,
<span class="pagenum2"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>political revolutions came to the help of the astrologers’ predictions,
who had interpreted the conjunction of the planets
as indicating physical changes.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifth century of the Hegira, the deluge
of the Assassins inundated the whole of Asia; and at the end
of the sixth, Jengis Khan rushed on, like a hurricane, and the
earth quaked under the hoofs of the Mongols. The rage of
the tempest afterwards spread through all Asia, and the
shocks of the earthquake carried their ruin as far as Europe.
During the reign of Mangu, the conquest of China and Persia
was completed by his brothers, Kublai and Hulaku; and as
the preponderating power of the latter, trod into ruins the
citadel of the Assassins, and rolled the khalif’s throne in the
dust, his expedition to Persia deserves our most particular
attention.</p>

<p>Tandju Newian, the general of Mangu Khan, who covered
the frontiers of Iran, sent to his master the ambassadors
of the khalif of Bagdad, who complained of the atrocities of
the Assassins, and besought him to extirpate the vile race.
Their complaints were seconded by those of the judge of
Kaswin, who was at the khan’s court, and went in armour to
the audience, fearing the daggers of the Assassins, against
whose crimes he raised the voice of humanity. Mangu immediately
collected an army, which he placed under the command
of his brother, Hulaku, whom, on departing, he addressed
in the following words: “I send thee, with much
cavalry and a strong army, from Turan to Iran, the land of
great princes. It is thine, to observe the laws and ordinances
of Jengis Khan, in great things, and in small, and to take possession
of the countries from the Oxus to the Nile. Assemble
round thee, with favours and rewards, the obedient and the
submissive; but tread into the dust of contempt and misery,
the refractory and mutinous, with their wives and children.
When thou hast done with the Assassins, begin the conquest
of Irak. If the khalif of Bagdad comes forward willingly to
serve thee, then shalt thou do him no harm; but, if he refuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
let him share the fate of the rest.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Upon this, Hulaku
went from Kara Kurum to the camp, and put his forces in
order, and reinforced them with a thousand families of Chinese
fire-work makers. These latter managed the besieging
machines and the artillery of flaming naphtha, which has
been known to Europe, under the name of the Greek fire,
since the Crusades; but was long before used by the Arabs
and Chinese, as well as gunpowder.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> In Ramadan,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> he broke
up his camp; and receiving constant reinforcements on his
march, he halted for a month, first at Samarkand and afterwards
at Kash.</p>

<p>Hither came Shemseddin Kurt and Emir Arghun, from
Khorassan, offering him its homage, and from hence he sent
ambassadors to the princes of the surrounding countries, with
this message: “By command of the khan, I am advancing
against the Assassins, to destroy them: if ye will support me
in this enterprise, your trouble shall be rewarded&mdash;your country
protected; but if ye conduct yourselves negligently, I
will, after having finished this affair, advance against you;
so shall ye know it&mdash;it is foretold to you.” As soon as the
news of the approach of his victorious standard was spread
abroad, ambassadors appeared from Rum, from Sultan Rokneddin,
Prince of the Seljuks in Fars, from the Atabeg Saad
of Irak, Aserbijan, Kurdjistan, and Shirwan, to offer the
homage of their masters.</p>

<p>The beginning of the month Silhidje, in the 553rd year
of the Hegira, Hulaku crossed the Oxus by a temporary
bridge, and amused himself by lion hunting on the hither
side. Here winter overtook him, and the cold was so severe,
that most of his horses perished. He was compelled to wait
till spring, when Arghun Khan appeared at his command in
the camp; the political affairs of the latter were conducted by
his son Gherai, Ahmed Bitegi, and Khoja Alaeddin Ata<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>-mulk,
the vizier, writer of the celebrated historical work
Jehan Kusha (<em>Conqueror of the World</em>). Hulaku marched
from Shirgan to Khawaf whence being himself attacked with
indisposition, he despatched his general, Kayu Kanian, on the
conquest of Kuhistan. He went himself to Tus, the native
city of the greatest Persian poet, astronomer, and vizier,
Ferdusi, Nassireddin, and Nisam-ol-mulk; the renowned
burial-place of the Imam Ali Ben Mussa Risa, and established
his quarters in a newly-laid out garden of Arghun Aka. From
thence he went to Manssuriye, where the wives of Arghun and
his lieutenant, Aseddin Taher, gave him a sumptuous banquet.
He then sent the Prince Shemseddin Kurt as ambassador
to Nassireddin Mohtashem, Rokneddin’s governor
in Sertakht. Although an old man, Nassireddin, the first
patron of the astronomer of the same name, who has immortalized
his memory by his ethical work dedicated to
him, nevertheless accompanied the envoy in person, to the
camp of Hulaku, who loaded him with marks of distinction.</p>

<p>Hulaku, on arriving on his march at Junushan, commanded
the place, which had formerly been destroyed by
the Mongols, to be rebuilt, at the public expense; he then
returned to Khirkan, where he sent another embassy to
Rokneddin Kharshah, the lord of Alamut, summoning him
to obedience and submission. Rokneddin had just ascended
the throne, still reeking with the blood of his father, and followed
in his political conduct the treacherous advice of his
vizier, the great astronomer, Nassireddin of Tus. The latter
had presented a work to the Khalif Mostrassem: for which,
instead of receiving honours and rewards, as he expected, he
only gained contempt and insult. Alkami, the khalif’s vizier,
jealous of Nassireddin, objected to the work, that, in the
dedication, the title of “Vicegerent of God on Earth,” was
wanting; and the khalif, who thought it badly written, threw
it into the Tigris.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span></p>
<p>From this moment, the insulted <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</em> swore vengeance
against the vizier and the khalif, and fled to Alamut, where
the grand-master still clutched his dagger, beneath which
more than one vizier and one khalif had already fallen. As
the grand-master, however, did not interest himself with
sufficient earnestness in Nassireddin’s revenge, or did not
expedite it quickly enough, for the approach of Hulaku
drew the attention of the order away from the khalif to the
consideration of their own defence; and as, according to all
probability, the citadel of the Ismailites would, at length, be
obliged to succumb to the hosts of the Mongols, Nassireddin
immediately changed his plan and designs. He resolved, in
the first instance, to deliver up his master, and the castles of
the Assassins, to the advancing victor, in order to ensure, by
treachery, the means to his ultimate revenge, and to pave the
way for the destruction of the khalif’s throne, with the ruins
of the order. He thus extended the prospect of his revenge,
and his joy at the fall of his foes took a wider compass.
The vizier and the khalif would only have bled under the
poniards of the Assassins; the burning brands of the Mongols,
however, menaced the conflagration of the capital, and the
whole edifice of the khalifat. The lust of destruction must
have been great in that mind, which could sacrifice the
Assassins to its revenge, because they unsheathed their
daggers too slowly for his purpose.</p>

<p>By the advice of Nassireddin, Rokneddin Kharshah sent to
Baissur Nubin, Hulaku’s general, who had already reached
Hamadan, an embassy of submission, and expressing his
desire to live in peace with every one. Baissur Nubin answered,
that as Hulaku was not far off, Rokneddin would
do best to go to him in person. After several messages, it
was determined, that Rokneddin should send his brother
Shehinshah in Baissur’s suite to Hulaku. Shehinshah addressed
himself to Baissur, and the latter gave him his own
son, as escort on his way to Hulaku; he himself, however,
by command of his lord, entered the district of Alamut, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
his army, on the 10th of the month Jemesi-ul-ewel, in
the 654th year of the Hegira.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> The Assassins and the troops
of the order occupied a height near Alamut, which they defended
obstinately against the Mongols. The rock was
steep, and the occupying party numerous. The assailants,
compelled to abandon the attack, burned the houses of the
Ismailites, and ravaged the fields. While this happened near
Alamut, and after Shehinshah had arrived at Hulaku’s quarters,
the latter sent an envoy to Rokneddin, with the command
as follows:&mdash;“Because Rokneddin has sent his brother
to us, we pardon him the guilt of his father and his partisans;
he himself, who has, during his short reign, as yet
proved himself guilty of no crime, shall destroy his castles,
and repair to us.”</p>

<p>At the same time, Baissur received orders to suspend
the ravaging of the province of Rudbar. After the arrival of
these orders, Rokneddin caused some of the battlements of
Alamut to be knocked down, and Baissur withdrew his troops
from Rudbar. By order of Rokneddin, Sadreddin Sungi,
one of the most respectable of the order, went, accompanied
by an envoy of Hulaku’s, to the latter’s camp, to announce
submissively to him, that the prince of the Assassins had
already begun to demolish his castles, and that he was proceeding
in the work of destruction; that he, however, dreading
the presence of Hulaku, requested the term of a year, after
the lapse of which, he would appear at his court. Hulaku
sent back Sadreddin, the Ismailite envoy, accompanied by one
of his basikakis, or officers, and wrote to the grand-master:&mdash;“If
Rokneddin’s submission be sincere, let him come to
the imperial camp, and cede to Basikaki, the deliverer of this
letter, the defence of his country.”</p>

<p>Rokneddin, misled by his evil genius, and the ill advice of
Nassireddin, delayed his obedience to this command. He
sent the vizier, Shemseddin Keilaki, and his cousin, Seifeddin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>Sultan Melik Ben Kia Manssur, again, with ambassadors, to
Hulaku, to cloak his refusal to appear in person, under bad
excuses. He commanded, at the same time, his governors
and commanders of Kuhistan and Kirdkuh, to hasten to the
Mongol camp, and to proffer their homage.</p>

<p>As soon as Hulaku reached Demawend, which lies immediately
on the mountains of the Assassins, he despatched
the vizier, Shemseddin Keilaki, to Kirdkuh, to bring the commander
of that fortress into the camp, in pursuance of Rokneddin’s
command; one of the envoys, who had accompanied
the vizier and Rokneddin’s cousin to the camp, was sent, on
the same mission, to Kuhistan, and the latter proceeded, with
Hulaku’s ambassador, to the castle of Maimundis, where
Rokneddin had established his residence, in order to inform
him that “the ruler of the world had now advanced as far as
Demawend; there was now no longer any time for delay; but
if he wished to wait a few days, he might, in the meanwhile,
send his son.” These ambassadors arrived at Maimundis
the beginning of Ramadan, and gave the intelligence that
Hulaku’s victorious standards were floating on the frontiers,
and communicated his commands. At this news, Rokneddin
and his people fell into stupid astonishment and helpless
terror. He answered the ambassador that he was ready to
send his son, but then, urged by the persuasion of his wives
and short-sighted advisers, he delivered to the envoy the
child of a slave, who, being of the same age as his son, was
substituted for him, and requested that Hulaku would allow
his brother, Shehinshah, who was still at his court, to return.
Hulaku, who was already on the confines of Rudbar, easily
unmasked the imposture, and, without betraying his discovery,
sent back the child, two days after, with the information
that, on account of his youth, the khan would not detain
him; and that, if he had an elder brother, he might be sent
into the camp, in exchange for Shehinshah, who would then
be permitted to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the governor of Kirdkuh had arrived
in the camp, and Hulaku, who now permitted Shehinshah,
Rokneddin’s brother, to return, dismissed him with these
words: “Tell thy brother to demolish the castle of Maimundis,
and come to me: if he comes not, the Eternal God
knows the consequences.” During these negociations, the
Tawadgi or recruiters of the Mongols, had collected so considerable
a number of troops, that hill and dale swarmed with
them. On the seventh of the month Shewal, Hulaku appeared
in person before Maimundis, to undertake the siege of
that fortress, and a battle took place on the 25th.</p>

<p>Rokneddin, ill advised, and still worse betrayed by Nassireddin,
sent, at length, his other brother, Iranshah, together
with his son, Kiashah, and the vizier, Nassireddin, into the
camp, to offer his homage and submission, and to request a
free retreat. They were accompanied by the most distinguished
members of the order, who bore rich presents.
Nassireddin, instead of speaking for his prince, and placing
the strength of the fortress in the balance of the negotiation,
told Hulaku, that the security of the castles of the Ismailites
need not trouble him, that the stars foretold clearly the
downfall of their power, and the sun would accelerate their
ruin. The surrender of the place was then agreed upon, on
condition of an unmolested retreat, and on the 1st of the
month Silkide, Rokneddin, and his ministers and confidents,
evacuated the castle of Maimundis, and went into Hulaku’s
camp. The gold and the presents, which he brought with
him, were divided among the troops. Hulaku had compassion
on Rokneddin’s youth and inexperience; he having scarcely
been seated more than a year, on the throne of his fathers.
He gave him good words and flattering promises, retained
him as his guest, but the traitor, Nassireddin, as his vizier.
The latter, who had put the fortress and the grand-master
into the hands of the khan, and had laid the axe at the root
of the Assassin power, had effrontery enough to compose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
a chronograph on this occurrence, which immortalizes his
treachery and revenge, containing the date of this affair, in
two verses.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<p>In Hulaku’s camp, Rokneddin was given into the custody
of a guard of Tartars; and officers of the khan accompanied
the grand-master’s deputies into the district Rudbar, in
order to demolish the castles belonging to the Assassins,
there situated: others were despatched to the two grand-priorates
of Syria and Kuhistan, to summon the commandants
of the places belonging to the order, to surrender them
to Hulaku, in the name of the last grand-master. The
number of these strongholds amounted to more than a
hundred; and these, by which the mountainous parts of
Kuhistan, Irak, and Syria, were crowned, formed the girdle
of the Assassins’ power, reaching from the shores of the
Caspian to those of the Mediterranean sea; in all these,
the dagger was the insignia of dominion. In Rudbar, alone,
more than forty were levelled with the ground, all well fortified
and full of treasure. The three strongest refused obedience
to Hulaku’s summons, and Rokneddin’s commands;
the commanders of Alamut, the grand-master’s capital, of
Lamsir and Kirdkuh, replied, that they were waiting for
the khan’s arrival to surrender them to him. Hulaku
struck his camp, and appeared, in a few days, before Alamut;
he sent the captive grand-master to the foot of the ramparts
to persuade the inhabitants by promises and threats, to
surrender; Rokneddin obeyed, but the governors of the fortress
refused to yield. Hulaku left a blockading force before
Alamut, and marched to Lamsir, whose inhabitants came
out to meet him, and offer their allegiance; the constancy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>the Alamuters being shaken by this, they sent an envoy to
Rokneddin, to beg him to intercede with the enraged prince
in their favour.</p>

<p>By the mediation of Rokneddin, Hulaku allowed the commander
a safe conduct to the camp. The inhabitants requested
three days to remove their money and goods, this was permitted;
and, on the third, the castle was given up to pillage.
Alamut, or the Eagle’s Nest, so called from its inaccessible
height, lay on a rock, which presented the shape of a lion
kneeling, with his neck stretched on the ground: the walls
rose from the lion’s rock, which they equalled in solidity, as
it did them in its perpendicular rise; they were vaulted for
the defence of the garrison; the rock was excavated into
corn magazines and cellars for honey and wine; these had
been, for the most part, filled in the time of Hassan Sabah;
and so excellent was the choice of the spot, and the care
bestowed upon it, that neither had the wheat become mouldy,
nor the wine sour; which was considered by the Ismailites
as a miracle of their founder. The Mongols, who, without
knowledge of the locality, sought in the subterraneous chambers
and cellars, for treasure, fell into the wine and honey.</p>

<p>The armies of the Assassins being scattered, and their
poniards broken in the destruction of their fortresses, Hulaku
returned in the month Selhidje, of the same year, to
Hamadan, where he had left his children. Rokneddin, who
accompanied him, was treated with kindness, either from
pity or contempt. Entirely degenerated from the blood of his
fathers, he had not even the virtues of a common Assassin,&mdash;courage,
and contempt of death; still less those of a grand-master,&mdash;strength
of rule and state-craft. Already morally a
slave, even before he fell into the hands of Hulaku, he still
showed himself in the same character by the meanness of
his pursuits. A Mongol girl, of the lowest grade, was the
object of his affections, and Hulaku, who neglected no opportunity
of exposing him to the shafts of public scorn, commanded
a solemn marriage, on being asked for the slave by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the prince of the Assassins. After the completion of the ceremony,
Rokneddin begged the favour of being sent to the
great khan Mangu: Hulaku was, at first, astonished at this
senseless request, by which Rokneddin sought his own destruction;
as, however, he did not feel himself called upon to
prevent it, he gave him permission, and a troop of Mongols, as
an escort. Rokneddin had promised on his way to persuade
the garrison of Kirdkuh, the last castle of the Assassins which
still held out against the Mongols, to surrender. He left
Hulaku’s camp at Hamadan, on the first of Rebi-ul-ewel, in
the 655th year of the Hegira;<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> as he passed Kirdkuh he
sent the inhabitants a public message, requiring them to surrender;
he, however, secretly instructed them to hold out,
and to deliver the fortress up to no one.</p>

<p>By this foolish, contradictory policy, by which he had
already entailed the ruin of the order, he now accelerated
his own. On arriving at Karakurum, the khan’s capital, the
latter, without admitting him to an audience, sent him the
following message: “If thou pretendest to be submissive,
wherefore hast thou not surrendered the castle of Kirdkuh?
return, and demolish the yet unyielded castles; then mayest
thou share the honour of appearing in our imperial presence.”
When Rokneddin and his escort, had reached the Oxus, on
his return, the latter, under pretence of taking refreshment,
made him dismount, and pierced him with their swords.</p>

<p>Mangu had already, some time before, issued the command
to Hulaku, to exterminate all the Ismailites, and not
to spare even the infant at his mother’s breast: and immediately
upon Rokneddin’s departure, the sanguinary task
was commenced, which had only been delayed till Kirdkuh
and the remainder of the castles of the Assassins in Kuhistan
and Syria should have fallen. He sent one of his viziers
to Kaswin, to put to death, indiscriminately, Rokneddin’s
wives, children, brothers, sisters, and slaves; only two rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>tions
(females apparently) of Rokneddin, were selected from
this devoted band, not for mercy, but to be the victims of
the princess, Bulghan Khatun’s, private revenge; her father,
Jagatai, having bled by the Assassin’s daggers. A command,
similar to that given to the governor of Kaswin, was issued
to the viceroy of Khorassan. He assembled the captive Ismailites,
and twelve thousand of these wretched creatures
were slaughtered, without distinction of age. Warriors went
through the provinces, and executed the fatal sentence, without
mercy or appeal. Wherever they found a disciple of the
doctrine of the Ismailites, they compelled him to kneel down,
and then cut off his head. The whole race of Kia Busurgomid,
in whose descendants the grand-mastership had been
hereditary, were exterminated. The “devoted to murder”
were not now the victims of the order’s vengeance, but that
of outraged humanity. The sword was against the dagger,
and the executioner destroyed the murderer. The seed,
sowed for two centuries, was now ripe for the harvest, and
the field ploughed by the Assassin’s dagger, was reaped by the
sword of the Mongol. The crime had been terrible, but no
less terrible was the punishment.</p>

<p>The castles of the Assassins in Rudbar and Kuhistan,
Kain, Tun, Lamsir, and even Alamut, the capital, were now in
the hands of the victor. Kirdkuh alone, whose garrison had
been encouraged not to yield, by Rokneddin, when on his way
to Mangu, resisted the besieging forces of the Mongols for
three years. It is situated in the district of Damaghan, near
Manssurabad, on a very lofty mountain, and is, probably, the
same as the castle Tigado, mentioned by the Armenian historian,
Haithon, who has converted the three years’ siege into
one of thirty years’ duration.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Circumstantial details of this
siege, are found in Sahireddin,<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> the historian of Masenderan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>and Ruyan, whose princes, having done homage to the overwhelming
power of Hulaku Khan, received his commands
to besiege Kirdkuh, while he was engaged in his expedition
against Bagdad. At that period, the throne of Mazanderan
was filled by Shems-ol-Moluk Erdeshir, of the family of
Bawend; and at Ruyan reigned the Astandar, or mountain
prince, Shehrakim, of the family Kawpare. They were united
in the bonds of friendship, relationship, and contiguity of
situation. The prince of Ruyan had given his daughter in
marriage, to the shah of Masenderan, and Hulaku Khan
promised himself a large result from the wisdom of his measures,
in imposing upon them both the conduct of the siege of
Kirdkuh.</p>

<p>It was in the beginning of spring, that the poet, Kutbi
Ruyani, who was in the camp of the allied princes, sung a
solemn poem, in honour of spring, in the language of Thaberistan,
beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container2">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">The sun has now once more passed from the Fish to the Ram,</div>
<div class="line">Spring waves her flowery banner to the east wind.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>By this distich, inserted by the historian, Sahireddin, in his
work, the existence of a particular language in Thaberistan is
made known to Europe. It consists of a mixture of Mongol,
Ouigour, and Persian words.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The inspiration of the native
poet, had so great an effect upon the two princes, that, without
waiting for the khan’s permission, they raised the siege, and
marched home, in order fully to enjoy, in their native plains,
the delights of returning spring, unmindful of the wrath of
Hulaku Khan, of which they soon felt the full weight. Gasan
Behadir was despatched from the army, to chastise them for
their disobedience. The prince of Ruyan, who had first set
his son-in-law the bad example of withdrawing, had the magnanimity
to take the whole fault upon himself, and, in order
not to expose his own, and his relative’s possessions, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>ravages of the Mongols, he went, of his own accord, to Amul,
where Gasan Behadir had encamped. He had the good
fortune to appease the khan, and received, both for himself
and the shah of Masenderan, a new investiture of their principalities,
which had been declared forfeited by their disobedience.</p>

<p>The effect of this invocation of spring, of the Thaberistani
poet, is, although in an opposite manner, no less remarkable
in martial and literary history, than are the hymns, with which
Tyrtæus animated the Spartans to the combat; and, if the
Greek poet has been imitated in our own time, in the songs
of the Prussian and Austrian soldiery, and with the happiest
effect, nevertheless, no siege has ever been raised yet, either
by the Pervigilium Veneris, or by Bürger’s imitation of it. This
desertion of the siege, by the two commanders, explains its
protraction, for full three years; a period, which, without being
extended to thirty, appears amply sufficient, since Alamut, the
strongest of the Assassin’s fortresses, yielded, on the third day,
after being summoned by Hulaku.</p>

<p>After the fall of Alamut, the residence of the grand-master,
and the centre of the order, Atamelik Jowaini, the learned
vizier and historian, asked and obtained from Hulaku, permission
to search the celebrated library and archives of the order,
for the purpose of saving the works which might be worthy
of the khan’s preserving. He laid aside the Koran and some
other precious books, and committed to the flames, not only
all the philosophical and sceptical works, containing the
Ismailite doctrine, and written in harmony with it, but also
all the mathematical and astronomical instruments, and thus
at once destroyed every source from which history might have
derived a more circumstantial account of the dogmas of the
Ismailites, and the statutes of the order. Fortunately, in his
own history, he preserved the results of the information
which he derived from the library and archives of the order,
together with a biographical sketch of Hassan Sabah, from
which all the more modern Persian historians, as Mirkhond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and Wassaf, have collected their stories, and which we ourselves
have likewise followed.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></p>

<p>The existence of this library, at the time of the Conquest,
convicts of hypocrisy the sixth grand-master, Jelaleddin
Nev Musulman; since he could not have committed to the
flames, in the presence of the deputies of Kaswin, the archives
and doctrinal works of the order which remain preserved, for
the inquisitorial zeal of Atamelik Jowaini. This fanatical zeal
has, at all periods, but particularly in the middle ages, converted
millions of books into ashes. If the west does, not
unjustly<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> (as Gibbon believes), accuse the Khalif Omar of the
conflagration of the Alexandrian library, the east returns the
charge with the accusation of the burning of the books at
Tripoli, where an immense library of Arabic works was consumed
by the Crusaders.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The assertion that, in the former
place, the baths were heated for a space of six months with
the wisdom of the Greeks, is as extravagant as that in Tripoli
alone, three millions of Arabic manuscripts fed the flames:
but that both conflagrations were lighted up by the torch of
fanaticism, is not, on that account, the less an historical fact,
clearly attested and confirmed by the first historians of the
east.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> The library of Alexandria was burnt by the Moslimin,
because, according to the instructions of Omar, the Koran
only was the book of books, and all knowledge not contained
in it was vain and useless. The library at Tripoli was consumed
by the Christians, because it contained, for the most
part, nothing but the Koran, and the works written on it. At
Alamut the Koran was preserved by Jowaini, and the philosophical
works written against it, doomed to destruction; and
at Fas, a century before, an <em>auto da fe</em> of theological books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>was held by Sultan Yakub.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Had these two alone been lost,
there would not be so much reason to complain; but
with them, the conflagrations of Alexandria and Alamut
swept away treasures of Grecian, Egyptian, Persian, and
Indian philosophy.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>BOOK VII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Conquest of Bagdad&mdash;Fall of the Assassins&mdash;Remnant of
them.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap"><big>I</big>n</span> the fall of Alamut, the centre of the Assassins was
gone; the props of their authority were broken, in the loss
of the castles of Rudbar and Kuhistan. Still, the grand-prior
of Syria refused submission to the grand-master’s
orders to surrender,&mdash;the armies of the Mongols being, as yet,
too distant to compel his obedience. A far greater object
occupied the mind of Hulaku, than the destruction of a few
Syrian mountain forts, in which the order, after the fall of
Alamut, and the annihilation of the Ismailites in Persia, might
yet, though with difficulty, raise its head. He entertained
no less a project than the conquest of Bagdad, and the overthrow
of the khalif’s throne, on which the Arabs had, in the
prophet’s name, already, for six centuries and a half, ruled
over the world of Islam. This great event is, not only by its
immediate consequences, but also from its proximate cause,
inseparably connected with the destruction of the Assassins.</p>

<p>In the second year after the fall of Alamut, and, consequently,
before the conquest of Kirdkuh the last fortress of
the Assassins, which only surrendered in the third year of the
siege, Bagdad, the queen of the cities of the Tigris, fell.
The overthrow of the khalifat, as we have seen, in the instructions
given by Mangu to his brother Hulaku, did not enter
immediately into the plan of the khan, who merely claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
submission and troops, but Nassireddin, the great <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</em> and
traitor, who had delivered the capital of the Assassins into
the conqueror’s hands, and had paved a road to his own
revenge, over its ruins, laboured unceasingly to urge Hulaku
to the destruction of the khalifat. Besides the close connexion
of this event with the one which we have described,
it is in itself so great and important, in the history of Asia,
and the middle ages,&mdash;so attractive, from the novelty and rarity
of the subject, that we cannot deny our readers and ourselves
the pleasure of following the khan, in his expedition from
Alamut to Bagdad.</p>

<p>The siege and conquest of Constantinople, by the Turks,
is, perhaps, the only event in history, worthy to be compared
with that of Bagdad, by the Mongols; and the fall of the long-sinking
Byzantine empire, may be placed by the side of that
of the khalifat. The conquest of other cities, on whose sieges
history has dwelt with astonishment and admiration, or with
pity and terror, is less mighty in its consequences, because,
under their ruins, no throne of universal sway has been buried.
This interest is wanting, in the most obstinate and glorious
sieges of ancient and modern history, however remarkable by
the great names of the assailants, or the consummate skill with
which they may have been prosecuted, or the patient courage
with which they have been defended. Tyre and Saguntum,
illustrious in their besiegers, Alexander and Hannibal; Syracuse,
which has immortalized the names of Marcellus and Archimedes;
Rhodes, twice attacked by Demetrius Poliorcetes,
and defended against the Turks, by Villiers de l’Isle Adam;
Candia, and Saragossa; have all earned unfading glory, by the
lion courage of their inhabitants and defenders; but, although
these cities fought for the highest of earthly objects&mdash;their
country’s freedom, still their fall did not draw down with it
the seat of the ancient dominion over half the world.</p>

<p>The history of the conquest of other celebrated cities, the
seat of universal monarchy, such as Babylon and Persepolis,
under whose ruin were buried the Assyrian and Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
monarchies, is wrapt in the distance of thousands of years,
and impenetrable obscurity. The destruction of Jerusalem
eclipses in the brightness of its lustre that of all those cities;
not, however, on account of the importance of its power, or
of its siege, for that by Khosroes was not less remarkable than
that by Titus; but because the latter was described by Tacitus.
If Gibbon had had access to the sources which are at our
command, the conquest of Bagdad would not have shone with
less splendour, in his immortal work, than that of Constantinople,
nor would it have been so briefly treated. What we
want of his power of expression, must be supplied by the
richness of the material.</p>

<p>After the fall of Alamut, and the other fortresses of the
Assassins, except that of Kirdkuh, Hulaku vacated the territory
of Kaswin, and marched to Hamadan, whither his general,
Tanju Nowian, hastened from Aserbijan, to lay an account
of his victories at the foot of the throne. Hulaku dismissed
him, with instructions to advance to Rum and Syria, and to
subject the whole of Asia and Africa, to the extreme western
boundary, to his dominion. In the month of Rebi-ul-ewel, in
the 555th year of the Hegira, he commenced his march against
Bagdad, and proceeded as far as Tebris, whence he sent an
ambassador to the khalif, Mostassem, with the message:
“When we went out against Rudbar, we sent ambassadors to
thee, desiring aid; thou promisedst them, but sentest not a
man. Now, we request that thou wouldst change thy conduct,
and refrain from thy contumacy, which will only bring about
the loss of thy empire and thy treasures.”</p>

<p>The ambassadors having despatched their mission to Mostassem,
the latter sent the learned Sherefeddin Ibn Jusi, the
most famous orator of his time, and Bedreddin Mohammed,
of Nahjiwan, to Hulaku, with a haughty message. The khan,
irritated at this, gave more easy audience to the counsels of
Nassireddin, who continually urged him to march against
Bagdad, and to the treacherous invitation of Ibn Alkami, the
khalif’s vizier. Moyededdin Mohammed Ben Mohammed Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Abdolmelek Alkami, who, as vizier, administered the affairs
of the khalifat with unlimited power, and, by the blackest
treachery, caused its fall, is stigmatized ignominiously, as
traitor, throughout the whole east; and the name of Alkami is
not less abhorred, in their history, than is that of Antalcides,
in that of the Greeks: as eloquent, and versed in poetry and
the polite literature of the Arabs, as Nassireddin was in the
mathematical sciences, he was no less faithless to his lord.
Both poet and mathematician were traitors.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>Nassireddin had personal cause of complaint against
Alkami, who, by his censure, had occasioned the khalif’s
throwing into the Tigris the poem dedicated to him by the
former; adding, that it was, in every respect, badly written.
It is probable, that Nassireddin was a better astronomer than
poet; but it is still more probable, that Alkami was jealous of
the credit which he might gain with the khalif. The vizier
would not have deemed it necessary to warn the viceroy of
Khorassan, Nassireddin Mohteshem, with whom the astronomer
was, against a mediocre or bad <em>Kasside</em>, who was a juggler, and
wished to insinuate himself into the favour of the khalif. Out
of respect for Alkami, the viceroy, on this warning, threw the
astronomer into prison, notwithstanding he had dedicated his
great work, Akhlaki Nassiri, to him. He escaped to Alamut,
where, as vizier of the last grand-master, he, meditating
revenge against Alkami and the Khalif Mostassem, laid the
foundation of it in the ruin of the Assassins.</p>

<p>Ibn Alkami, like Nassireddin, swore vengeance against the
khalif: he had to complain, not only of the neglect of some
of the grandees and favourites being unpunished by Mostassem,
but also, he feared for his own personal security, on
account of some severe measures against the Shiites, to which
sect he himself belonged. He entered, therefore, on the same
path of treachery, in which Nassireddin had already preceded
him, and besieged the ear of Hulaku, with complaints and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>invitations, which were readily accepted. Nassireddin, Hulaku’s
vizier, and Ibn Alkami, the khalif’s, played mutually
into each other’s hands. The contemporaneous fall of two such
powerful sovereignties, as that of the Assassins and of the
khalifat, caused by the jealousy and treachery of an astronomer
and a wit, is unique in history.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>Ere we commence the detail of the fall of the khalif throne
of Bagdad, it will be proper to premise a few words, relating
to the foundation and splendour of this renowned city.</p>

<p>Bagdad, the city, valley, or house of peace, the citadel of
the holy, the seat of the khalifat, called also the oblique,<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> from
the oblique position of its gates, was founded, on the banks
of the Tigris, in the 148th year of the Hegira, by Abujafer
Almansur, the second khalif of the Abbas family. It stretches
two miles along the eastern banks of the river, in the form of
a bow with an arrow on the string, and is surrounded by a
brick wall, whose circumference of twelve thousand four
hundred ells, is interrupted by four gates and one hundred
and sixty-three turrets. When Mansur resolved upon building
the city, he called his astronomers, at whose head was
his vizier, Nevbakht (i. e. <em>new fortune</em>), to determine a fortunate
hour for laying the foundations; and the latter chose a
moment when the sun stood in the sign Sagittarius, by which
the new city was promised flourishing civilization, numerous
population, and long endurance. At the same time he assured
the khalif, that neither he, nor any of his successors, would
die within the walls of this capital; and the confidence of the
astronomer, in the truth of his prophecy, is less surprising
than its fulfilment by thirty-seven khalifs, the last of whom,
Mostassem, during whose reign Bagdad fell, did not die
within its walls, but at Samara, a place built below Bagdad,
on the banks of the Tigris, by Motassem, the eighth Abbaside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>khalif (called the eighther from the coincidence of the number
eight, in his nativity) for his Mameluke guard.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>As Bagdad, from the circumstance of no khalif having
died within its walls, merited, most peculiarly, the name of
the House, Valley, or City of Peace; so, also, on account of
the great number of holy men of Islam, who are buried within
or without it, and whose tombs are so many objects of the
pilgrimages of the Moslimin, it gained the title of Bulwark
of the Holy. Here are the mausolea of the greatest
imams and the most pious sheikhs. Here reposes the Imam
Mussa Kasim, the seventh of the twelve imams, who, in direct
descent from Ali, claimed the right to the throne and the khalifat,
on account of their relationship to the prophet; also,
the imams, Hanefi and Hanbeli, the founders of two of the
four orthodox sects of the Sunna; the sheikhs, Juneid, Shobli,
and Abdolkadir-Ghilani,<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> the chiefs of the mystic sect of
the sofis.</p>

<p>In the midst of the monuments of the imams and sheikhs,
stand those of the khalifs, and their spouses; of which that
of Zobeide, the wife of Harun al Rashid, has, by the strength
of its construction, survived the repeated captures and destructions
of Bagdad, by the Mongols, Persians, and Turks.
Equally splendid specimens of Saracenic architecture are the
academies, colleges, and schools; two of which have immortalized
the names of their founders in the history of Arabic
literature. The academies, Nisamie and Mostansarie, the
former instituted in the first half of the fifth century of the
Hegira, by Nisam-ol-mulk, the great grand-vizier of Melekshah,
sultan of the Seljuks, the latter, built two centuries
later, by the Khalif Almostansar-billah, with four different
pulpits for the four orthodox sects of the Sunnites.</p>

<p>The most magnificent of all the palaces was that of the
Khalif Moktader-billah, called the “House of the Tree,”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> and
seated in a wide extent of gardens. In the middle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>vestibule, near two large basins of water, stood two trees of
gold and silver, each having eighteen branches, and a great
number of smaller boughs. One of these bore fruit and
birds, whose variegated plumage was imitated with different
precious stones, and which gave forth melodious sounds, by
means of the motion of the branches, produced by a mechanical
contrivance. On the other tree were fifteen figures of
cavaliers, dressed in pearls and gold, with drawn swords,
which, on a signal being given, moved in concert. In this
palace, the Khalif Moktader gave audience to the ambassadors
of the Greek emperor, Theophilus,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> and astonished them
with the numbers of his army, and the splendour of his court.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
A hundred and sixty thousand men stood in their ranks before
the palace; the pages glittered in golden girdles; seven
thousand eunuchs, three thousand of whom were white, the
rest black, surrounded the entrance; and, immediately at the
gate, were seven hundred chamberlains. On the Tigris
floated gilded barks and gondolas, decorated with silken flags
and streamers. The walls of the palace were hung with
thirty-eight thousand carpets, twelve thousand five hundred
of which were of gold tissue; and twenty-two thousand
pieces of rich stuff covered the floors. A hundred lions,
held by their keepers with golden chains, roared in concert
with the sound of fifes and drums, the clang of the trumpets,
and the thundering of the tamtam.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p>The entrance to the audience chamber was concealed by
a black silk curtain; and no one could pass the threshold,
without kissing the black stone of which it was formed, like
the pilgrims at Mecca.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> Behind the black curtain, on a throne
seven ells high, sat the khalif, habited in the black mantle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>(<em>borda</em>) of the prophet, girded with his sword, and holding
his staff in his hand as a sceptre. Ambassadors, and even
princes, who received investiture, kissed the ground in front
of the throne, and approached, conducted by the vizier and
an interpreter, and were then honoured with a habit of ceremony
(<em>khalaat</em>), and presents. So Togrul-beg, the founder
of the Seljuks, on receiving investiture from the Khalif Kaim-Biemrillah,
was dressed in seven caftans, one over the other,
and presented with seven slaves, from the several different
states forming the khalifat. He received two turbans, two
sabres, and two standards, in token of being invested with the
sovereignty of the east and the west.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>These proceedings of the khalif’s court were copied by that
of Byzantium; and traces of them have been preserved to
the present day, in the ceremonials of the great kingdoms
both of the east and the west. Theophilus, whose love of
splendour rivalled that of the khalif, built a palace in Constantinople,
the exact counterpart of the “House of the Tree,”
even to the golden tree,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> and the artificial singing birds on it;
which was no less an object of admiration to the envoys of
the European courts, than the original at Bagdad had been to
the Greeks. The etiquette of the khalif’s court, which was
repeated at Byzantium, still subsists at the Constantinopolitan
courts, as Luitprand describes it. When the khalif rode
out, he was saluted with the shouting a long formula of benediction;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
in the same manner was the Greek emperor, with
the cry of “Many years” (πολυχρονιζειν)! and so is the Ottoman
sultan, at this day, with the usual “<em>Tehok-yasha</em>” (may he
live long)! The two turbans, which are placed before him
when he enters the mosque, signify his sovereignty over Asia
and Europe; the prophet’s sword and mantle are preserved
in the treasury of the seraglio. The <em>borda</em>, that is, the
Arabian prince’s mantle of black, afterwards embroidered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>with gold, is still worn by the princes of Lebanon, and the
emirs of the desert; its colours, black and gold, were adopted
in the livery of the Roman emperor.</p>

<p>The military force no longer bore any proportion to the
splendour and magnificence with which the sinking throne of
the khalifat was still enriched, as in the glorious days of
Moktader. The army, indeed, still consisted of sixty thousand
cavalry, under the command of Suleimanshah; but
even this number was diminished by Ibn Alkami’s treachery.
The latter proposed the curtailing the forces, and dismissing
the men, in order to save their pay and preserve the treasure;
and, in spite of the opposite warning of the four greatest
officers of state, the commander-in-chief, Suleimanshah, the
first and second ink-holders, or secretaries of state, and the
chief cup-bearer, he lulled the khalif into security from the
danger of the Mongols, so that he carelessly stretched himself
on the pillow of ease and effeminacy.</p>

<p>While he was occupied with the conquest of Kuhistan,
and the extirpation of the Assassins, Hulaku received a letter
from Ibn Alkami, who promised to deliver into his hands, the
bulwarks and treasure of the khalif city; and magnifying the
charms of the capture, he studiously depreciated the dangers
of the attempt, till they disappeared. The khan, however,
did not blindly trust the traitor’s promises; the former unsuccessful
attempts upon Bagdad were too fresh in his memory.
Churmaghun, the general of Jenghis Khan, had, during
the reign of the Khalif Nassir-ledinillah, twice advanced
against Bagdad, with an army of a hundred and twenty-four
thousand men; and twice was he beaten back, with the loss
of the greater part of his forces. Hulaku had recourse to
Nassireddin, his vizier, and, through him, to the stars; in
which the latter naturally read the overthrow of the khalifat,
so long determined upon by his revengeful spirit. Ibn Alkami’s
divining-rod struck on the deeply-concealed vein of
Nassireddin’s inveterate rancour, and treachery responded to
revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with Nassireddin’s counsels, Hulaku, as
soon as he reached Hamadan, sent the before-mentioned embassy
to the khalif, whom he requested to send to meet him,
one of the two secretaries of state, the chief cup-bearer, or
the commander of the army, with whose opposition to his
views he was fully acquainted. The khalif sent the learned
orator, Ibn-al-jusi, who poured the oil of his eloquence into
the fire of wrath, and returned, without performing his task.
Hulaku, still more enraged, commanded the Emir Sogranjan
to advance to Erdebil, and cross the Tigris, and then to form
a junction with the troops of the Emir Boyanje, on the western
side of Bagdad. In the meanwhile, he himself broke up
his head-quarters at Hamadan. On the news of the advance
of the Mongol vanguard reaching Bagdad, the khalif despatched
Fetheddin, one of his oldest and most experienced
commanders, with the secretary of state, Mujeheddin, one of
his young favourites, and a thousand cavalry, armed with
lances, who, in the first action, beat the Mongols, and forced
them to retreat.</p>

<p>Fetheddin’s grey-headed experience wished to encamp;
but Mujeheddin’s youthful arrogance incited him so long with
insulting charges of cowardice and treachery, that he, at last,
gave orders to pursue the enemy. They overtook them at
the western branch of the Tigris, called Dojail, or Little
Tigris. Fetheddin mounted a common horse, on whose fore
and hind legs he had iron chains fastened, and so remained in
one spot, to show to all that he was determined not to desert
his post in the field, and that he would either conquer or die
there. Night, and the fatigue of both armies, put an end to
the combat, and dropping their arms, they sank into those of
sleep; but while the khalif’s army were buried in slumber,
the Mongols cut through some dykes, and the water broke
impetuously on the opposing forces. The darkness of the
rushing waters, and that of the night, was made still darker,
by the despair of the army. Then they saw the words
of the Koran fulfilled: “Darkness on darkness; everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
darkness;” and, like Pharoah’s host, they were buried in
the waves. The brave old Fetheddin, whose prudence
would have averted the danger, perished; and the rash
youth, Mujeheddin, whose arrogance had produced it, escaped
with two or three companions, who brought the news of the
catastrophe to Bagdad. So blind was the khalif’s partiality
to his favourite, so slight his sorrow for the loss of his army,
that on receiving the intelligence, he merely exclaimed, three
times, thankfully: “God be praised for the preservation of
Mujeheddin!” And when the enemy had already advanced
as far as Jebel-Hamr (the red mountain), three days’ march
from Bagdad, and he was informed of their approach, he
only replied: “How can they pass that mountain?” All
representations to the contrary were either unheard or ineffectual.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the main body of the Mongols had
pushed forward on the road of Yakuba, and was encamped
on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Then only did the khalif
command the gates of Bagdad to be shut, the fortifications
to be garrisoned, and preparations to be made for defence.
The two secretaries and Suleimanshah once more led the
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</em> of the army, against the enemy. The battle lasted two
days, with various fortune, but with equal loss: on the third,
Hulaku prohibited the Mongols from renewing the attack,
and resolved to enclose the city in a blockade. On all the
heights without the city, and on all the towers and palaces
which commanded it, were placed projectile engines, throwing
masses of rock and flaming naphtha, which breached the
walls, and set the buildings on fire.</p>

<p>At this period, the three presidents of the sherifs, or
descendants of Ali, who resided at Helle, on the banks of the
Euphrates, not far from the ruins of Babylon, sent a letter to
Hulaku, in which they offered their submission, and added
bitter complaints of the wrongs which they had suffered from
the khalif. They informed him, that according to a tradition
preserved by their glorious ancestor, the Lion of God, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
sage of the faith, the son-in-law of the prophet Ali, the son
of Abu-taleb, the period of the fall of the family of Abbas,
and the conquest of Bagdad, was arrived. Hulaku, equally
pleased with the homage of the descendants of the prophet
and with the prophecy, answered them graciously, and commanded
his general, Emir Alaeddin, to occupy the district of
Helle, and to protect the inhabitants from violence. Thus
their hatred against the family of Abbas secured them against
the rage of the Mongols.</p>

<p>After the siege had lasted forty days, the khalif convoked
a general assembly of all the grandees of the realm, in which
Ibn Alkami spoke at great length of the innumerable host of
the Mongols, and the impossibility of long resisting them;
he therefore, recommended a treaty with Hulaku, who was
more desirous of the treasures than the dominions of the
khalif; he advised a mutual alliance between a daughter of
Hulaku and a son of the khalif, and between a daughter of
the latter and a son of the former, that the ties of peace and
friendship might be drawn the closer. For this purpose, the
khalif should go in person to the khan’s camp, and thus the
blood of thousands would be spared, the city preserved from
utter destruction, and the khalifat fortified against every
enemy by the acquisition of so powerful an ally.</p>

<p>The fear and pusillanimity of the khalif caused him to
listen to Alkami’s faithless advice. He sent him, in the first
place, into the camp to negotiate peace, under the same conditions
as had been offered to him from Hamadan; he returned
with the answer, probably suggested by himself, that “What
was admissible at Hamadan, is no longer so before the gates
of Bagdad.” Then, only one of the great dignities of the
realm was demanded; now all four were, namely: the
commander of the army, Suleimanshah, the two ink-holders
or secretaries of state, and the chief cup-bearer. The siege
continued six days longer with renewed vehemence; on the
seventh, Hulaku caused six letters of immunity to be prepared,
in which it was stated that the kadis and the seids, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
sheikhs and imams who had not borne arms should be secure
of their lives and property; these letters were attached to
arrows, and shot into the city on six sides. One of the two
secretaries, who despaired of the safety of the city, and was
more anxious for his own, embarked on the Tigris to seek it
in flight; as however, he came abreast of Kariet-ol-akab,
he was stopped by a body of the Mongol troops, posted there
for the purpose of cutting off the communication between Medain
and Basra. Three of his vessels fell a prey to the
flaming naphtha, and he was himself compelled to return.
The khalif, who had already renounced all hope, now sent
Fakhreddin Damaghani, and Ibn Derwish, with presents to
Hulaku, and to treat with him concerning the conditions of
peace. These two, however, returning without success, he
despatched, on the following day, his son Abulfase Abdorrahman,
with very considerable presents, and, on the third, his
brother Abulfasl Abubekr, with the noblest and greatest personages
in the state. These embassies were as fruitless as the
first, and the vizier, who was sent into the camp along with
Ibn-al-jusi, again brought back the surrender of Suleimanshah
and the secretaries, as the indisputable condition of the
khalif’s free exit.</p>

<p>Suleimanshah, and one of the secretaries, after being assured
of a safe conduct, went to Hulaku, who sent them back to
the city, commanding them to bring with them their families
and whole household, in order that he might send them unobstructedly
to Syria and Egypt; they returned to the camp
with a considerable escort of troops, who seized this opportunity
of deserting the city. Different quarters had just been
assigned them, when an Indian struck out the eye of one of
Hulaku’s principal emirs, with an arrow; Hulaku seized this
accident as a pretext for the most sanguinary rage; he commanded
the secretary of state and his suite to be put to
death, and the general, Suleimanshah, and his officers, to be
brought, bound, before him: he said to him, “How comes it,
that so great an astrologer as thou could not foresee the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
hour of thy death? Wherefore didst thou not counsel thy
lord to enter the path of submission, in order to save thy
own life and that of others?” Suleimanshah replied, that “the
khalif’s evil star had made him deaf to good advice.” After
some interrogatories and replies of this kind, the general and
his officers were put to the sword.</p>

<p>Many thousands, who had surrendered into the hands of
the conqueror on the faith of the safe conduct, were murdered,
unarmed, after they had been separated from each other,
on pretence of being sent into different provinces; a cold-blooded
and faithless cruelty, which, however, is not without
example, having been repeated both in the east and in the
west. The history of Alexander, of Charlemagne, Jengiskhan,
Timur, and other conquerors, presents us with instances
similar to this atrocity of Hulaku, agreeing also wonderfully
with it in the number of the victims,&mdash;from three to four
thousand,&mdash;as well as in the circumstances of the promised safe
retreat, the division into detachments, and the dialogue held
with the commanders, who, for that very reason, were the
more certain of their lives being spared.</p>

<p>The khalif seeing no farther hope of saving his life except
by surrendering to the conqueror, repaired to the khan’s
camp, after a siege of forty-nine days, on Sunday, the 4th of
the month Jafer, in the 656th year of the Hegira; he was
attended by his brother and his two sons, together with a
suite of nearly three thousand persons, kadhis, seids,
sheikhs, and imams; only the khalif and the three princes,
his brother and two sons, together with three of the suite
(one in a thousand), in all, seven persons, were admitted
to an audience. Hulaku concealed the perfidy of his designs
under the mask of smooth words, and the most friendly
reception. He requested the khalif to send word into
the city that the armed inhabitants should throw away their
weapons, and assemble before the gates, in order that a
general census might be taken. At the order of the khalif
the city poured out its unarmed defenders, who, as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
the person of Mostassem, were secured. The next day,
at sunrise, Hulaku issued commands to fill up the ditch,
demolish the walls, pillage the city, and massacre the inhabitants.
The ditch, according to the expression of the Persian
historian, deep as the deep reflections of wisdom, and the
walls as high as the soaring of a lofty mind, were, in an hour,
levelled. The army of the Mongols, as numerous as ants
and locusts, mined the fortifications like an ant-hill, and then
fell upon the city as destructive as a cloud of the latter;
the Tigris was dyed with blood, and flowed as red as the
Nile, when Moses, by a miracle, changed its waves into blood;
or, it was at least as red as the Egyptian river is to this day,
when it is swollen by that annual miracle of nature, its
overflow, and coloured red by the red loam and sand which
it washes down from Abyssinia; affording a natural explanation
of the Mosaic miracle.</p>

<p>The city was a prey to fire and the sword; the minarets
and domes of the mosques glowed, like fiery columns
and cupolas; from the roofs of the mosques and baths, flowed
melted gold and lead, setting on fire the palm and cypress
groves which surrounded them. The gilded battlements of
the palaces fell like stars to the earth,&mdash;like the demons who
endeavoured to scale the battlements of Heaven. In the
mausolea, the mortal remains of the sheikhs and pious imams,
and in the academies, the immortal works of great and learned
men, were consumed to ashes; books were thrown into the
fire, or where that was distant and the Tigris near, were
buried in the waters of the latter. Gold and silver vessels
from the palaces and kitchens of the great, fell, in such quantities,
into the hands of the ignorant Mongols, that they sold
them by weight, like brass or tin. The treasures of Asiatic
splendour and art, accumulated for centuries in the khalif’s
city, became the booty of barbarians. So great a quantity
of Persian and Chinese gold tissues, Arab horses, Egyptian
mules, Greek and Abyssinian slaves of both sexes, coined
and uncoined gold, silver, pearls, and precious stones, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
found, that the private soldier became richer than even the
chiefs of the army or the khan himself had ever been before.
And yet the treasures of the khalif’s palace had not been
touched, as these the khan retained for himself.</p>

<p>After four days’ pillage, he went, on the 9th of the month
Safir, in company with the khalif, to the palace of the latter;
where he, as his guest, as he said, desired his host to give
him all that he was able. This Mongol politeness struck the
khalif with such terror, that his whole body trembled, and as
he either had not the keys, or could not find them, he
ordered the bolts and locks to be broken open. Two thousand
costly garments, ten thousand ducats, and many jewels,
were brought out; which the khan, without deigning them a
glance, distributed among his suite, and then turned to the
khalif, with the words: “Thy public treasures belong to my
servants; now produce thy concealed ones.” Mostassem
pointed to a spot, on excavating which were found the two
basins of treasure, so celebrated in the history of the khalifat,
each filled with bars of gold, weighing each a hundred miscals.
Nassir-ledinillah’s wise economy had commenced filling these
two vessels; Mostanssur’s prodigality emptied them; and
Mostassem’s avarice again replenished them.</p>

<p>An anecdote is told, in the history of the last reigns of the
khalifs, that Mostanssur, when he paid his first visit to this
treasure, prayed aloud: “Lord, my God! grant me the favour
to be enabled to empty both these vessels during my reign!”
The treasurer smiled, and being asked his reason, he said:
“When thy grandfather visited this treasure, he besought
heaven to reign only until he had filled these two basins;
while thou desirest precisely the reverse.” Mostanssur applied
this gold in the foundation of useful institutions, which immortalize
his name; particularly in the erection of the celebrated
academy, which was named after him, Mostansarie,
and also Omm-ol-Medaris, that is, the Mother of Academies.
Mostassem, on the other hand, hoarded gold from
avarice; whereas, a politic application of his riches, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
pay of troops and tribute, might have saved his throne from
ruin.</p>

<p>Hulaku’s cruelty to Mostassem, realized the Grecian fable
of the wishes of King Midas. He commanded plates filled
with gold to be placed before him, instead of food; and on
the khalif’s observing that gold was not food, the Mongol told
him, by an interpreter: “For that very reason that it is not
food, wherefore hast thou not rather given it to thine army to
defend thee, or distributed it amongst mine to satisfy me?”
Too late, Mostassem repented the consequences of his avarice,
and after spending a sleepless night, tormented with the
pangs of hunger and conscience, he prayed, in the morning, in
the words of the Koran: “O Lord, my God! possessor of
all power; thou givest it to whom thou wilt, and takest from
whom thou wilt; thou raisest up and pullest down whomsoever
thou pleasest; in thy hands is all goodness, and thou
art mighty over all things!”</p>

<p>The khan now held a council of his ministers, to deliberate
concerning the fate of the khalif; and it being their
unanimous opinion, that prolonging his existence would only
be preserving the bloody seeds of war and insurrection, and
that only with his life could the dominion of the khalifat be
terminated, his death was determined. But as Hulaku himself
deemed it improper that the khalif should suffer as an ordinary
criminal, and the blood of the prophet’s successor be
shed by the sword, Mostassem was wrapped in a thick cloth,
and beaten to death. So great was the religious veneration for
the sacred person of the khalif, and thus did eastern etiquette
extend even to the execution of kings. From similar motives
of reverence, the Ottoman sultans, when a revolt costs them
their lives, are not strangled, but are put to death by compression
of the genitals:&mdash;a singular and elaborate trait of
executioner tenderness!</p>

<p>As the pillage and sack of Bagdad had commenced four
days before the khalif’s death, so it continued forty days
afterwards; till the barbarians dropped their swords from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
fatigue, and fuel was wanting for the flames. If we abstract
the usual horrors of insulted humanity, which have been
repeated in every sacked city, and only in Bagdad were carried
to the highest pitch of enormity, we shall not blame the
Mongols so much in their conquest of that city, for the conflagration
of the mosques, and the desecration of the mausolea,
for the destruction of the immense treasures, and the
melting of the gold and silver vessels, nor even for the demolition
of the bulwarks of holiness, and the overthrow of the
khalif throne, as for the annihilation of the libraries, and
the loss of many hundred thousand volumes, which fell a prey
to the flames.</p>

<p>They consisted of the treasures of Arabic literature,
the accumulation of nearly five hundred years; together with
the relics of the Persian, which had probably been saved
from the destruction of Medain. As the second khalif had
commanded his general, in Egypt, to consume the Alexandrian
library, so he also caused that of Medain, the residence of
Khosroes, to be thrown into the Tigris; and Omar, whom
some European historians have in vain endeavoured to exculpate
from this high treason against literature, is loaded
with the double guilt of the double <em>auto da fe</em> of the
Greek and the Persian library, by fire and water. As the
Arabs destroyed these libraries, five centuries before, in two
years; so did the Mongols, in the same space, annihilate the
Arabian libraries of Alamut and Bagdad. To this double
conflagration must be added, that of the great libraries of
Tripoli, Nishabur, and Cairo, in the same century. Thus
the conjunction of the seven planets in the same sign of the
zodiac, which indicated, according to some astrologers, a
universal deluge, and according to others, a universal conflagration,
might be justly understood to signify the inundation
of the Mongols, and the burning of the libraries.</p>

<p>A most melancholy observation is suggested by the destruction
of the libraries of Alamut and Bagdad; it is, that
the fall of both was caused by the guilt of learned men: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
former, by the perfidy of the astronomer, Nassireddin; the
latter, by the treachery of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bel esprit</em>, Ibn Alkami; both
being sacrificed to their revenge. The fate of these two
learned statesmen, distinguished alike by their great talents
and evil hearts, who caused the overthrow of the Assassins
and the khalifat, falls now to be mentioned. A few words
will suffice. After the conquest of Bagdad, Nassireddin built
the celebrated observatory of Meragha; by which, as well as
his astronomical tables, both his name and that of Hulaku
are immortalized in the history of astronomy. Thus that
science derived, at least, some advantage from the many
evils in which astrology had been its handmaid. Ibn Alkami,
the man of letters, and vizier, instead of the reward
he expected, reaped that of a traitor. As such, treated
by the Mongols with the most profound contempt, he died,
in a few days, a prey to remorse and despair. The inhabitants
of Bagdad wrote on every wall, over the gates
of the caravanserais and schools, in large letters cut in marble:
“The curse of God on him who curses not Ibn Alkami!”
One of the traitor’s partisans, a Shiite, having expunged the
“not” from one of these inscriptions, was punished with
seventy blows of the bastinado. The name of Ibn Alkami is
intimately interwoven with that of Nassireddin, in the history
of the fall of the Assassins, and the khalifat. Asia long
trembled from the shock of the violent fall of the empire of
the dagger, and the prophet’s staff.</p>

<p>The conquest of Bagdad has almost diverted us from our
proper object, not merely by the intrinsic importance of the
subject, but also on account of its intimate connexion with the
end of the Assassins, whose overthrow prepared that of the
khalifat.</p>

<p>After their castles in Rudbar and Kuhistan had been
razed to the ground, and numbers of them massacred and
scattered, they still maintained their stand, for fourteen years,
in the mountains of Syria, against the armies of the Mongols,
the Franks, and the Egyptian sultan, Bibars, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
greatest princes of the Circassian Mamelukes of Egypt. This
prince, who zealously sought for supreme power, was not inclined
to share it any longer with the remains of the Assassin
order, which had been chased from the mountains of Persia.
During his reign, Frank and Arab vessels put into the
Egyptian ports,<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> with embassies; which the Christian and
Arabic princes, such as the German emperor, Alphonso of
Arragon, the commander of Yemen, and others, sent with
rich presents to the Syrian Ismailites. Bibars, in order to
show that he was far above all fear of the order, levied on all
these presents the usual customs; and sent to the superior in
Syria, a letter, full of threats and reproaches. Terrified and
humbled by their misfortunes in Persia, they answered submissively,
and with the request that the sultan would not
forget them in his peace with the Franks, but include them in
his treaty, in token of his protection of them as his slaves;
and, in fact, Bibars, who, in this year, concluded a peace with
the knights-hospitallers, made the abolition of the tribute paid
by the Ismailites, one of the conditions of the treaty. The
following year, he received an embassy of the Ismailites, who
sent him a sum of money, with the words: “That the money
which they had hitherto paid to the Franks, should, in future,
flow into the treasury of the sultan; and serve for the pay of
the defenders of the true faith”.<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<p>Three years afterwards,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> when Sultan Bibars was marching
against the Franks, in Syria, the commanders of the different
towns appeared to do him homage. Nejmeddin, the grand-master
of the Assassins, however, instead of following this example,
requested a diminution of the tribute, which the order
now paid to the sultan instead of the Franks. Saremeddin
Mobarek, the commandant of the Ismailite fortress, Alika,
had formerly drawn upon himself the anger of the sultan; but
having received pardon on the intercession of the governor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>Sihinn, or, according to others, of Hama, he appeared with a
numerous suite, in Bibar’s presence, who received him into
favour and loaded him with honours. He granted him the
supreme command of all the castles of the Ismailites in Syria,
which were no longer to be governed by Nejmeddin, but by
Saremeddin, in the name of the sultan of Egypt. Massiat, as
the property of the sultan, was subjected to the command of
Emir Aseddin. In conformity with his orders, Saremeddin
appeared before the walls of this fortress; of which he possessed
himself, partly by stratagem, and partly by the massacre
of a number of the inhabitants. Nejmeddin, the late
grand-master of the order, an old man of seventy years of
age, and his son, implored the sultan’s clemency. He had
compassion on them; and granted the former the restoration
of his authority, in conjunction with Saremeddin, in
consideration of an annual tribute of a hundred and twenty
thousand drachmas. A contribution of two thousand gold
pieces, was required of Saremeddin; and Nejmeddin left his
son in the sultan’s court, as a pledge of his obedience and
fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Saremeddin having taken possession of
Massiat, drove out Aseddin, the governor named by the sultan;
but not being able to maintain the place against the
approaching forces of the sultan, he threw himself into the
castle of Alika. Aseddin returned from Damascus, whither
he had taken refuge, again to Massiat, to the command of
which he was restored by the sultan’s troops, who left him
a garrison and body guard. Malik Manssur, Prince of Hama,
who had been charged by Bibars with the restoration of the
emir, and the deposition of Saremeddin, took the latter prisoner,
and brought him before the sultan, who threw him into
a dungeon. The castle of Alika surrendered to the sultan’s
army on the 9th of Shewal.</p>

<p>Nejmeddin, the former grand-prior, again held the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>mand
of the Ismailite castles in Syria,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> in the name of the
sultan, by whom Shemseddin was retained at court, as the
pledge of his father’s fidelity. On a suspicion being raised
against him, he came in person to court, and offered, with his
son, Shemseddin, to deliver up all the castles, and to live in
future in Egypt; his offer was accepted, and Shemseddin departed
for Kehef, to induce the inhabitants to surrender
within twenty days. Not appearing, however, at the end of
this term, the sultan admonished him, by letter, to fulfill his
promise; and Shemseddin desired that the castle of Kolaia
should be left in his possession, in exchange for which he engaged
to yield all the rest. The sultan acceded to his request;
and sent Aalemeddin Sanjar, the judge of Hama, for the
purpose of receiving from Shemseddin, the oath of allegiance,
and the keys of Kehef; the inhabitants, however, secretly
instigated by the latter, refused to admit the envoy.</p>

<p>A second embassy having no better effect, Bibars gave
orders for the castle to be besieged. On this, Shemseddin
left Kehef, and repaired to the sultan, who was encamped
before Hama, and was honourably received; receiving, however,
intelligence in a letter, that the inhabitants of Kehef
had sent Assassins into the camp, in order to murder his
principal emirs, Bibars caused Shemseddin and all his suite
to be arrested, and carried into Egypt. At the same time,
two officers of the order, who had persuaded their friends in
the castle of Khawabi, to surrender to the sultan, were seized
at Sarmin. This castle surrendered to negotiation, that of
Kolaia to force; and, in the following year, those of Menifa
and Kadmus fell into the sultan’s hands. The inhabitants of
Kehef wished to oppose a longer resistance; but being closely
blockaded, and cut off from all relief, they at length sent
Bibars the keys of the town; and the Emir Jemaleddin
Akonsa made his entry on the 22d of Silvide.</p>

<p>From this moment, Bibars was master of all the forts and
castles which had been in the possession of the Ismailites;
and he ruined their power in Syria, as Hulaku had done in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>Persia. Next to Massiat, the residence of the grand-master,
Shiun, a strong place on a rock, abundantly supplied with
water,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> and at a short day’s journey from Latakia, had been
lately particularly distinguished, by the valiant exploits of its
commandant, Hamsa, one of the greatest heroes among
the Syrian Ismailites. This Hamsa must not be confounded
with Hamsa, the companion of the prophet, and one of the
bravest heroes of Mohammedanism; nor with Hamsa, the
founder of the religion of the Druses. The numerous battles
and enterprises of the Assassins, their valorous defence
against the armies of the Crusaders, and the Egyptian sultan,
Bibars, and the adventurous character of their whole history,
offered a fertile source to the Syrian romance writers and
story-tellers; a source of which they did not fail to avail
themselves.</p>

<p>This was the origin of the Hamsaname, or Hamsiads,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> a
kind of chivalrous romance, modelled after the style of the
Antar, Dulhemmet, Benihilal, and other Egyptian works.
After the conquest of Syria, by the Ottomans, the tales of the
feats and adventures of Hamsa passed from the mouths of
the Arabian story-tellers and coffee-house orators, to those
of the Turks; and Hamsa, together with Sid Battal (Cid y
Campeador) the proper Cid of the orientals, an Arabian hero,
who fell in battle against the Greeks, at the siege of Constantinople,
by Harun al Rashid,<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> afforded the richest materials
for Turkish romances, which are exclusively occupied
by the feats of Hamsa and Sid Battal. The tomb of the Sid
in the Anatolian Sanjak Sultanoghi is, to this day, a much
frequented resort of pilgrimages, enriched by the Sultan
Suleiman, the legislator, with the endowment of a mosque, a
convent, and an academy.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>The conquest of Massiat was succeeded by that of Alika,
and, at length, two years after, by that of Kahaf, Mainoka
Kadmus, and of the other castles on the Antilebanon; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>thus the power of the Ismailites was overthrown, both in
Syria and Persia. One of their last attempts at assassination
is said to have been directed against the person of St. Louis,
King of France, but the falsity of this supposition has already
been demonstrated, by French writers.<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p>The power of the Ismailites had now terminated, both in
Persia and Syria; the citadels of the grand-master, in Rudbar,
and of the grand-priors, in Kuhistan and Syria, had fallen;
the bands of the Assassins were massacred and scattered;
their doctrine was publicly condemned, yet, nevertheless,
continued to be secretly taught, and the order of the Assassins,
like that of the Jesuits, endured long after its suppression. In
Kuhistan, in particular, remains of them still existed; that
being a region which, on account of its very mountainous
character, was more impracticable than the surrounding countries,
and, being less accessible to the persecutors of the
order, it afforded the partisans of the latter a more secure
asylum.</p>

<p>Seventy years after the taking of Alamut and Bagdad, in
the reign of Hulaku’s eighth successor, Abu Said Behadir
Khan, the great protector of the sciences, to whom Wassaf
dedicated his history, the whole of Kuhistan was devoted to
the pernicious sect of the Ismailites, and the doctrine of Islamism
had not yet been able to enter the hearts of the natives,
hard as their mountain rocks. Abusaid determined, in concert
with the lieutenant of the province, Shah Ali Sejestani,
to send an apostolic mission, for the conversion of these miscreants
and infidels. At the head of the society of missionaries,
which was composed of zealous divines, was the
Sheikh Amadeddin, surnamed of Bokhara, one of the most
esteemed jurisconsults, who, on the destruction of that city,
had fled to Kuhistan. His grandson, Jelali, in his work,
“Nassaih-ol-Moluk” (<cite>Counsels for Kings</cite>), dedicated to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>Sultan Shahrokh, the son of Timur, relates the history of
this mission from the mouth of his father, who had accompanied
his grandfather to Kuhistan.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<p>Amadeddin, with his two sons, Hossameddin and Nejmeddin,
the father of Jelali, and four other Ulemas, in all seven
persons, went to Kain, the chief seat of the Ismailites; where,
since the illuminative period of Hassan II., the mosques
had fallen down, the pious institutions decayed&mdash;where
the word of the Koran was no longer heard from the pulpit,
nor the call to prayers sounded from the minaret. As prayer,
five times a day, is the first of the duties of Islamism,
and the call to it proclaims aloud the creed of the faithful,
Amadeddin resolved to commence his mission with it. He
went, therefore, with his six companions armed, to the terrace
of the castle of Kain, from whence, they began, at the same
instant, to cry out on all sides: “Say God is great! there is
no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet. To prayers!
Up! to do good!” This summons, to which the unbelieving
inhabitants had long been unaccustomed, instead of collecting
them in the mosque, excited them to a tumult against the
summoners; and, although the latter had taken the precaution
to be armed, they did not deem it expedient to purchase
the crown of martyrdom with their lives, by defending
themselves, but took refuge in a drain, where they hid.
As soon as the people were dispersed, they again mounted
the terrace, and repeated the call to prayers, and the
retreat to the drain. In this manner, their obstinate zeal,
supported by the power of the governor, succeeded in accustoming
the ears of the infidels to the formula of the summons
to prayer, and then to that of prayer itself; and sowed the
good seed of the true doctrine of Islamism on the waste field
of infidelity and atheism.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p>While the political wisdom of Abusaid was endeavouring
to extirpate the Ismailite doctrine in Persia, its ashes still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>smouldered in Syria; and, from time to time, threw out
destructive flames, which were extinguished in the blood of
the slaughtered victims. As it had originated in Egypt,
and had but served as an instrument of the ambitious designs
of the Fatimites; so the Circassian sultans of that country
availed themselves of the last fruits of the wide-spread tree
of murderous policy, in order to execute their revenge, and
to try the dagger on those enemies who resisted the sword.
A memorable instance of such an attempt, is afforded us in
the history of the Emir Kara Sonkor, who had deserted the
court of the Egyptian sultans, and had entered into the service
of the khan of the Mongols.</p>

<p>Two years after<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> Abusaid had sent the before-mentioned
learned Jelali to Kuhistan, the Egyptian sultan, Mohammed,
the son of Bibars, sent no less than thirty Assassins from
Massiat to Persia, to sacrifice the Emir Kara Sonkor to his
vengeance. They arrived at Tebris, and the first having been
cut to pieces in his murderous attempt, the report was soon
spread that Assassins were come to murder the Khan Abusaid,
the Emir Juban, the Vizier Ali Shah, and all the Mongol
nobles. A second attempt on the life of Kara Sonkor
cost, like the former one, that of the murderer. A similar
attack had been made on the governor of Bagdad, and Abusaid,
the great khan, prudently shut himself up in his tent
for eleven days. Nevertheless, the Egyptian sultan, Mohammed,
did not give up his vengeful attempt on the life of Kara
Sonkor. He sent a merchant, named Yunis, to Tebris, with a
large sum of money, to hire new Assassins. Yunis sent for
them from Massiat, and concealed them in his house. One
day, as the Emir Juban was riding in company with the Emirs
Kara Sonkor and Afrem, two Assassins watched a favourable
opportunity to murder the two latter. The first assailant,
who was too hasty in his attack on the Emir Afrem, only tore
his clothes with his dagger, instead of wounding his breast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>and being cut down on the spot, the second did not think it
advisable to approach Kara Sonkor.</p>

<p>Inquiries were immediately set on foot into the Funduks
(<em>Fondaeki</em>) of Tebris, for the purpose of discovering the
haunts of the Assassins; the merchant, Yunis, was arrested,
but his life was preserved by the interest of the vizier. The
Emirs Afrem and Kara Sonkor took all necessary precautions
for the preservation of their own. A servant of the latter,
a native of Massiat, searched the whole city of Tebris, to
find out the Assassin who was to have poniarded his lord;
and found him, at last, in the person of his own brother. The
emir, in order to gain him over, gave him a hundred pieces of
gold, and a monthly salary of three hundred dirhems, together
with other presents; for which, he was induced to betray his
accomplices. One of them escaped; another stabbed himself;
a third expired under the torture, without confessing
anything.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Assassins at Bagdad executed
their commission better than those at Tebris. One of them
threw himself on the governor, as he was going out to ride,
and plunged his dagger into his breast, saying: “In the name
of Melek Nassir;” and escaped so quickly to Massiat, that he
could not be overtaken. From that place, he sent information
of the accomplishment of the murder of the governor, to Sultan
Mohammed.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The two emirs redoubled their vigilance;
and, by means of the Ismailite in Kara Sonkor’s pay, discovered
four others, who were immediately put to death. Nejmeddin
Selami, who had been sent as ambassador, from
Mohammed to the Khan Abusaid, insinuated himself into a
confidential intercourse with the Emir Juban, and the vizier.
He informed his master of the execution of the four Assassins;
in whose place four others were immediately sent;
three of them being arrested and discovered, expired under
the pangs of the torture; fortunately for Selami, the fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>escaped, who was the bearer of the sultan’s letter to his
plenipotentiary at Massiat, whence he apprised the sultan
of the ill success of his mission.</p>

<p>Selami continued his negotiations with the Emir Juban
and the vizier, so happily, that they concluded a peace with
the sultan, on condition that he should send no more Assassins
into their country. Notwithstanding this, the Emir Kara
Sonkor was attacked anew, while he was hunting, by a murderer,
who only, however, wounded his horse in the thigh,
and was immediately killed by the guard. Even in the suite
of the Emir Itmash, who came on his second embassy to Abusaid’s
court, two Assassins were detected; one of whom immediately
stabbed himself, and the other, after refusing to
confess, was put to death in chains. Juban loaded Itmash with
reproaches, saying that, by sending these murderers, the sultan
scoffed at the treaty; and the ambassador assured him, in return,
that if they really were Assassins, they must have arrived
at Tebris, before it was signed. After Itmash and Selami
had returned to the sultan, their master, in Cairo, the latter
wrote once more to the Massiat Ismailites, reproaching them
for not fulfilling their contract. They sent him for answer,
one of their best Fedavis, a great eater, who devoured a calf,
and drank forty measures of wine a-day. After being kept
some time, at Keremeddin’s house, in Cairo, he went to the
court of the great Khan Abusaid, in the suite of Selami, who
was sent as ambassador, with presents.</p>

<p>At the feast of Bairam, when the emirs were attending
the khan, Selami ordered the Assassin to watch the moment
when Kara Sonkor should leave the palace, from the banquet:
“The first,” said he, “who comes out, is the destined victim.”
By accident, the vizier called the Emir Kara Sonkor back, just
as he was on the point of quitting the palace; and the governor
of Rum, who was dressed in red, like him, fell beneath the
blows of the murderer, who jumped from a roof on to the
governor’s horse, and stabbed him. Being taken, he died
under the most horrible tortures, without confessing a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Murderer succeeded murderer, in attempting to satisfy the
sultan’s desire of revenge; but, fortunately, Kara Sonkor escaped
them all. If we may credit the testimony of Macrisi,
no less than one hundred and twenty-four Assassins lost their
lives in attempting that of Kara Sonkor; so little is the life of
man in the power of his species, and so incapable are the
tools of murder of cutting the thread of those days, which
the Almighty has numbered.</p>

<p>Three generations after Abusaid’s mission, when the
whole of Kuhistan had returned, at least in appearance,
within the pale of the true faith, the Sultan Shahrokh, the son
of Timur, sent Jelali, of Kain, who usually lived in Herat,
and was thence called Al Herat, and Al Kaini, for the purpose
of ascertaining the state of belief in that province. Jelali felt
himself the more called upon to engage in this inquisitorial
affair, as his grandfather had presided over the apostolic mission,
and because the prophet had appeared to him in a dream,
and put a broom in his hand, with which he was to sweep the
country. He interpreted this vision as a celestial call, by
which he was appointed to the high office of cleansing away
all the impurities of unbelief; and he entered upon it with a
conscientious zeal, and a spirit of more than Islamitic toleration.
His before-mentioned work, “The Counsels for
Kings,” contains the results of the report of his inquiry
given to Sultan Shahrokh, and likewise, some information
respecting the secret policy of the still unconverted Ismailites,
taken from Jowaini’s “History of Jehan Kusha (<cite>the Conqueror
of Worlds</cite>).”</p>

<p>Within the space of eighteen months, Jelali travelled
through the whole of Kuhistan; and every where found that
the Ulemas, or teachers of the law, were true orthodox Sunnites.
The seids, the descendants of the prophet, passed for
such; and, still more, the dervishes, who represented themselves
to be sofis, or mystics. The emirs of Tabs and Shirkuh
were good Sunnites; but the commanders of the other
castles, and even the servants of the government (<em>Beg-jian</em>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
were to be suspected. For the rest, the peasants, merchants,
mechanics, were all good Moslimin.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the people were entirely devoted to the
true doctrine of Islamism, still it appears that the order preserved
its existence in secret, long after the loss of temporal
power, in the hope of, sometime or other, recovering it, under
more favourable circumstances. The Ismailites, indeed, no
longer ventured to unsheath the dagger against their foes;
but the chief aim of their policy, to acquire influence in affairs
of state, remained; they, in particular, sought to make proselytes
of the members of the divan; in order, by this means,
to secure the majority of voices in their favour, and to stifle
in their birth, all complaints and denunciations of their secret
doctrine. For this reason, the author of “Jehan Kusha,
(<cite>Conqueror of the World</cite>),” as well as the writer of the “Siasset-ol-Moluk”
(<cite>Art of Governing; or, Discipline of Kings</cite>),
warns princes to place in the divan none of the officers of
Kuhistan, who were more or less to be suspected, on account
of their principles. When intrusted with the management of the
finances, they were, indeed, never in arrear with their contracts;
so that the public treasury had never any claims against them;
they, however, ruined the villages which they farmed, and sent
the surplus of the taxes to their secret superiors, who still
preserved an existence at Alamut, the centre of the ancient
splendour of the order. Thither also flowed a portion of
the revenues of pious institutions, the produce of which was
destined for the support of mosques and schools, servants of
religion, and teachers. Similar well-intentioned warnings
have, in our own times, been frequently given to princes:
the attentive ear of government is always the most powerful
obstacle to the rise of secret orders and societies to power.</p>

<p>Remains of the Ismailites still exist both in Persia and
Syria,<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> but merely as one of the many sects and heresies of
Islamism, without any claims to power, without the means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>obtaining their former importance, of which they seem, in fact,
to have lost all remembrance. The policy of the secret state-subverting
doctrine of the first lodge of the Ismailites, and
the murderous tactics of the Assassins, are equally foreign to
them. Their writings are a shapeless mixture of Ismailite
and Christian traditions, glossed over with the ravings of the
mystic theology. Their places of abode are, both in Persia
and Syria, those of their forefathers, in the mountains of
Irak, and at the foot of Antilebanon.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<p>The Persian Ismailites recognise, as their chief, an imam,
whose descent they deduce from Ismael the son of Jafer-Essadik,
and who resides at Khekh, a village in the district of
Kum, under the protection of the shah. As, according to
their doctrine, the imam is an incarnate emanation of the
Deity, the imam of Khekh enjoys, to this day, the reputation
of miraculous powers; and the Ismailites, some of whom are
dispersed as far as India, go in pilgrimage, from the banks
of the Ganges and the Indus, in order to share his benediction.
The castles in the district of Rudbar, in the mountains
of Kuhistan, particularly in the vicinity of Alamut, are still
inhabited, to this day, by Ismailites, who, according to a late
traveller, go by the general name of Hosseinis.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>The Syrian Ismailites live in eighteen villages, dispersed
round their ancient chief place, Massiat, and are under the
rule of a sheikh or emir, who is the nominee of the governor
of Hamah. Being clothed in a pelisse of honour, he engages
to pay to Hamah an annual sum of sixteen thousand five
hundred piastres; his vassals are divided into two parties,
the Suweidani and Khisrewi: the former so named after one
of their former sheikhs; the latter, for their extraordinary
veneration of the prophet Khiser (Elias), the guardian of the
spring of life: the former, who are by far the smaller number,
live principally at Feudara, one of the eighteen places under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>the jurisdiction of Massiat; three miles east of that fortress
lies a strong castle, whose name, pronounced Kalamus, is
probably the same with the Kadmos of Arabian historians and
geographers; from thence, the chain of mountains, after
several windings, descends to the sea, near Tripoli.</p>

<p>In 1809, the Nossairis, the neighbours and enemies of the
Ismailites, possessed themselves, by treachery, of their chief
fortress, Massiat; the inhabitants were pillaged and murdered;
the booty amounted to more than a million piastres
in value. The governor of Hamah did not suffer this rash
enterprise of the Nossairis to go unpunished; he besieged
Massiat, and compelled them to resign the fortress to its
ancient possessors; the latter, however, sunk into complete
political insignificance. Externally they practise the duties
of Islamism with austerity, although they internally renounce
them: they believe in the divinity of Ali; in uncreated light
as the principle of all created things; and in the Sheikh Rashideddin,
the grand-prior of the order in Syria, contemporary
with the grand-master, Hassan II., as the last representative
of the Deity on earth.</p>

<p>We shall mention here, in passing, as they are neighbours
of the Ismailites, the Nossairis, the Motewellis, and the
Druses, three sects anathematized by the Moslems, on
account of their infidelity and lawlessness. Their doctrine
agrees, in many points, with that of the Ismailites; their
founders having been animated with the same spirit of
extravagant fanaticism,&mdash;of unprincipled licentiousness. The
Nossairis and Druses are both older in their origin than the
eastern Ismailites; the former having appeared in Syria, as a
branch of the Karmathites, as early as the fifth century
of the Hegira; the latter received their laws from Hamsa,
a missionary of Hakem-biemrillah’s from the lodge of Cairo.
The former believe, like the Ismailites, in the incarnation
of the divinity in Ali; the latter consider that maddest of
tyrants, Hakem-biemrillah, as a god in the flesh. Both abjure
all the rules of Islamism, or only observe them in appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>ance;
both hold secret and nocturnal assemblies stigmatized
by the Moslimin, where they give themselves up to the enjoyment
of wine and promiscuous intercourse.</p>

<p>The origin and doctrine of the Motewelli is less known
than that of the Nossairis and Druses. Their name is corrupted
from Motewilin, the <em>interpreters</em>; and therefore, probably,
indicates a sect of the Ismailites, who taught the
<em>Tenvil</em>, or allegorical interpretation of the commands of
Islamism, in opposition to the <em>Tensil</em>, or positive letter of
the word, not from God, the sense of which is a command to
the true believer.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p>The reproach of immorality, which these sects share in
common, is certainly much more applicable to the Motewellis
than to their neighbours. For the inhabitants of the village
of Martaban, on the road from Latakia to Aleppo, who offer
travellers the enjoyment of their wives and daughters, and
who consider their refusal as an affront, are Motewellis.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p>In still worse report than the Ismailites, Motewellis, Nossairis
and Druses, are some tribes of Syrian and Assyrian
kurds, who are called Yezidis, because they hold in peculiar
veneration Yezid, the khalif of the Ommia family, who persecuted,
sanguinarily, the family of the prophet, and likewise
the devil, neither of whom they curse like other Moslimin.
Their sheikh is called Karabash, that is, Blackhead, because
he covers his head with a black scarf. The name of their
founder is Sheikh Hadi, who, according to opinion, prayed,
fasted, and gave alms for all his future disciples; so that
they believe themselves exempted from these duties of
Mohammedanism, and that, in consideration of his merits,
they will go to heaven without appearing before the tribunal
of God.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<p>All these still existing sects are designated by the Moslimin,
generally, Sindike (<em>free-thinkers</em>), Mulhad (<em>impious</em>), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>Batheni (<em>esoterics</em>), and, on account of their nocturnal assemblies,
sometimes the one, sometimes the other, receive from
the Turks the name of <em>Mumsoindiren</em>, or the <em>extinguishers</em>;
because, according to the accusations of their religious
adversaries, they extinguish the lights, for the purpose of
indulging in promiscuous intercourse, without regard to
kindred or sex.</p>

<p>Similar charges have been, at all times, raised against secret
societies, whenever they concealed their mysteries under the
veil of night; sometimes groundlessly, as against the assemblies
of the early Christians, of whose innocence Pliny affords
a testimony; sometimes but too well founded, as against the
mysteries of Isis, and, still earlier, against the Bacchanalia of
Rome. As the latter was the first secret society mentioned
in Roman history, as dangerous to the state, and which assumed
religion as a cloak to every enormity, the similarity
of the subject, renders the mentioning them not out of place
here.</p>

<p>As, in the sixth century, after the flight of the prophet,
and the establishment of Islamism, the pest of the Ismailites
threatened, under the appearance of religion, to undermine and
overthrow the edifice, so, also, in the sixth century, after the
foundation of Rome and the republic, the pest of the Bacchanalians,
menaced the ruin of the city and the state, under the
mask of religion.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>“A Greek, of mean extraction,” says Livy, “came first
into Etruria, skilled in none of the arts which that most
learned of all nations has devoted to the culture of the mind
and the body, but a sacrificer and soothsayer; not that he
spread his doctrine by public teaching, or filling the mind
with a sacred horror, but, as the president of secret and
nocturnal sacrifices. At first, but few were initiated; afterwards,
however, the people, both men and women, were
admitted. In order to attract the mind the more, wine and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>banquets were added to religious sacrifices. When the intoxication
of the wine, night, the mixture of the sexes, and of
youth and age, had extinguished every shadow of shame, vice
and corruption of all kinds burst forth, every one having
at hand the means of gratifying his desires. There was
not merely one species of vice and the mere promiscuous
intercourse of noble youths and maidens; but also from this
source proceeded false witnesses, false documents, false informations,
and accusations, poisoning, and secret murder,&mdash;so
secret, indeed, that even the bodies of the dead were not
found for sepulchre. Much was attempted by stratagem, but
most by violence. Violence remained concealed, because, in
the midst of the yells, and noise of cymbals and drums, the
cries of the violated and the murdered could not be heard.”</p>

<p>The consul, Posthumus, had no sooner given intelligence
to the senate of the discovery of the existence and object of
this secret society, than the latter adopted the most powerful
measures, for the safety of the state and the commonweal,
and proceeded against the members of the Bacchanalia, as
criminals against the state, with the utmost rigour. The
speech of the consul to the people, advised them to watch
over the peril which threatened the state, from the conspiracy
of vice with religion. “I am not sure (said he) that some of
you may not have fallen into error; for nothing has a more
deceptive appearance than corrupted religion. When the
Deity is made a cloak for iniquity, the mind is seized with
terror, lest, in the punishment of human imposture, some
divine law may be transgressed.” This unveiling of crime,
from which the mask of religion had been torn, and the rigour
with which the Bacchanalians were persecuted, not only in
Rome, but also throughout Italy, with the sword and exile,
stifled, in its birth, the monster whose increasing strength
menaced the state with ruin. Had the princes of the east
acted in the same spirit towards the first secret societies and
the emissaries of the lodge of Cairo, as the senate and consuls
had done, the sect of the Ismailites would never have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
attained political influence, nor would the blood-dropping
branch of Assassins have sprouted from that poisonous stem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as we have seen in the course of this
history, several princes were themselves devoted to the secret
doctrine of infidelity and immorality, and others were deficient
in strength to restrain its progress with effect. Thus,
through the blindness of princes and the weakness of governments&mdash;through
the credulity of nations, and the criminal
presumption of an ambitious adventurer, like Hassan Sabah,
the monstrous existence of secret societies and an <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">imperium
in imperio</em>, attained so frightful an extent and power, that the
murderer seated himself openly upon the throne, and the
unbounded dominion of the dagger in the hands of the Assassins
was an object of terror to princes and rulers, and insulted
mankind in a manner unexampled and unique in history. We
have, more than once, briefly pointed out the analogy which
the constitution of the order of the Assassins presents with
contemporary or more modern orders; but, although so many
points of similarity are found, which can neither be accidental
nor yet spring from the same cause, but which, probably,
through the medium of the Crusades, passed from the spirit
of the east into that of the west, they are still insufficient to
make a perfect companion to the order of the Assassins,
which, thank Heaven, has hitherto been without parallel.
The Templars, incontrovertibly, stand in the next rank to
them; their secret maxims, particularly in so far as relates to
the renunciation of positive religion, and the extension of
their power by the acquisition of castles and strong places,
seem to have been the same as those of the order of the
Assassins. The accordance, likewise, of the white dress and
red fillets of the Assassins, with the white mantle and red
cross of the Templars, is certainly remarkably striking.</p>

<p>As the Templars, in many respects, trod in the footsteps of
the Assassins, so also did the Jesuits, whose exertions for the
aggrandisement of their order, and its preservation, if not by
political power, at least by secret connexions and influence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
agree entirely with the similar policy of the Assassins after
the fall of Alamut. The Assassins were, themselves, as we
have seen, a branch of the Ismailites, the proper Illuminati
of the east. The institution of their lodge at Cairo; the
various grades of initiation; the appellations of master, companions,
and novices; the public and the secret doctrine;
the oath of unconditional obedience to unknown superiors, to
serve the ends of the order; all agree completely with what
we have heard and read, in our own days, concerning secret
revolutionary societies; and they coincide not less in the form
or their constitution, than in the common object of declaring
all kings and priests superfluous.</p>

<p>The ostensible object of this institution was in itself
sufficiently laudable, and the exoteric doctrine had merely for
its object the extension of knowledge, and the mutual support
of the members. The house of science, at Cairo, or the
public school of the lodge, was the temple of the sciences,
and the model of all academies; the greater number of the
members were certainly deceived into good faith by the fair
exterior of a beneficent, philanthropical, knowledge-spreading
form; they were a kind of Freemasons, whose native
country, as we have seen, may really be sought and found
in Egypt, if not in the most ancient times, at least in the
history of the middle ages. As in the west, revolutionary
societies arose from the bosom of the Freemasons, so in the
east, did the Assassins spring from the Ismailites.</p>

<p>Traces of retribution immediately executed, which fulfilled
the sentence of the order as infallibly as though it were the
arm of fate itself, are, perhaps, likewise to be found in the
proceedings of the Vehme, or secret tribunal, although its
existence only commenced two hundred years after the extermination
of the order of murderers in Asia.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The insanity
of the enlighteners, who thought that by mere preaching,
they could emancipate nations from the protecting care of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>princes, and the leading-strings of practical religion, has
shown itself in the most terrible manner by the effects of the
French revolution, as it did in Asia, in the reign of Hassan II;
and as, at that period, the doctrine of assassination and treason
openly proceeded from Alamut, so did the doctrine of regicide
produce from the French National Convention, in Jean de
Brie, a legion of regicides. The members of the Convention
who sat with Robespierre on the side of the mountain, and
who decreed the king’s execution, would have been satellites
worthy of the Old Man of the Mountain. Like the initiated
to murder, they almost all died a violent death.</p>

<p>The dominion of the Assassins sank under the iron
tramp of Hulaku; their fall drew after it that of the ancient
throne of the khalif, and of other dynasties; thousands bled
under the conquering sword of the Mongols, who went forth
as the scourge of Heaven&mdash;like Attila and Jengis Khan, to
steel with blood the deadened nerves of nations. After him,
the remains of the hydra of Assassination quivered in the remnant
of the sect of the Ismailites, but powerless and venomless;
held down by the preponderance of the government
in Persia and Syria; politically harmless, somewhat like the
juggling of the Templars of the present day, and other secret
societies watched by the vigilant eye of the police in France.</p>

<p>In writing this history, we have set two things before us
as our object, to have attained which is less our hope than
our wish. In the first place, to present a lively picture of
the pernicious influence of secret societies in weak governments,
and of the dreadful prostitution of religion to the
horrors of unbridled ambition. Secondly, to give a view of
the important, rare, and unused historical treasures, which
are contained in the rich magazine of oriental literature.
We have but seized the prey which the lions of history have
abandoned: for Müller, in his twenty-four books of history,
has not mentioned the Assassins at all; and Gibbon, who,
according to his own avowal, let no opportunity escape him
of painting scenes of blood, has treated them but superficially;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
although, at the same time, both these great historians have
snatched from oblivion, with the pencil of the most masterly
description, many other insignificant events, the sources of
which were accessible to them. We may easily estimate
from this condensed account of all that is worth knowing
of and concerning the order of Assassins, and which is but
sparingly scattered through the works of eastern writers,
how many concealed rarities and costly pearls are to be
found in the untrodden depths of the ocean of Oriental
history.<br /><br /></p>

<p>After giving a view of the dogmas of the Ismailites, Rousseau
adds:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>“Such were, substantially, the dogmas of the first Ismailis; and
such, nearly, are those which their descendants in Syria profess to
this day. I say, nearly; for there can be no doubt that the latter,
having fallen so tremendously from their ancient social organization,
must also have lapsed from their original faith. This belief,
now more than ever disfigured, is become, to the last degree, extravagant,
from a mass of abuses and senseless superstitions, introduced
in the course of time. A certain Sheikh Rashideddin, who appeared
among them, I believe, three hundred years ago, put the finishing
stroke to their errors, by making them believe that he was the last
of the prophets, in whom the divine power was to be manifested.
This impostor, who was profoundly versed in the sacred writings, appears
to be the author of the book, some fragments of which I have
translated, and in which he promulgates his principles as if he were
himself the Almighty.”</p>

<p>The sovereign of the Assassins is called <em>sheikh</em>, by oriental authors.
Vincent le Blanc names him, <em>Ségucmir</em>, a word compounded of <em>sheikh</em>
and <em>emir</em>, and makes him reside in Arabia; but nothing that such an
author says is astonishing. The Arabic word <em>sheikh</em>, which is equivalent
to the Latin <em>Senior</em>, and which has its two significations in the
lower Latinity, has been ridiculously rendered <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetus</em>, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetulus</em>; <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senex</em>,
instead of <em>Senior</em>, when <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dominus</em> was not meant. We read <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetulus de
Monte</em>, in the chronicle of Nicholas of Treveth, A. D. 1236; <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetulus
de Montanis</em>, in that of William de Nangis, of the same year; <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetulus
de Montibus</em>, several times in Sanuto; and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senex de Montanis</em>, in the
Latin translation of Marco Polo. In Haïton, <em>Sexmontius</em> is but the
contraction of <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Senex montis</em>, which Batilli, who translates it, <em>Prince of
Six Mountains</em>, has not understood: we have seen him called <em>Summus</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span><em>Abbas</em>, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prolatus</em>, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister Cultellorum</em>, by James de Vitri: in the same
author, we read that this sovereign was commonly called <em>simplex</em>.
He gives himself the title of “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simplicitas Nostra</em>,” in his letter to
Philip Augustus, handed down by William of Newbury: this is one
of the two which have been supposititiously attributed to him. This
<em>simplicity</em> consisted in inhumanly putting to death those whom he
deemed enemies of his sect, or whom he regarded as extortioners, as
William of Tyre expresses himself. The Assassins exercised their
enormities alike, against both Mahommedans and Christians: we see
in history the catalogue of khalifs, princes, and viziers, slain by their
emissaries.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> I am also convinced, that the sheikh, simple as he
entitled himself, caused assassinations to be committed at the solicitation
of other princes, from motives of interest, in which religion had
no share. We are justified in believing this, from what their commandant
in Syria said to Henry the Second, Count of Champagne,
when he invited him to pass through his domains: “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si inimicum
aut insidiatorem regni haberet, ab hujus modi servis suis continuò interfici
procuraret.</em>” These are the words given by Sanuto; so that,
when the chief of the Assassins is made to speak otherwise, in his
letter, dated from Massiat, and inserted by Nicholas of Treveth, in
his chronicle (A. D. 1192): “<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sciatis quod nullum hominem mercede
aliqua vel pecuniá occidimus</cite>,” it is a reason why we should suspect
it to be false. In fact, it is very probable that the English fabricated
the letter addressed to Leopold, Duke of Austria, in order to procure
the liberty of King Richard I., whom he detained in prison; and
that, at the same time, they addressed another to Philip Augustus, to
remove his suspicions about the murder of the Marquess of Montferrat,
and to obviate his acting hostilely against them in their king’s
absence. The best justification of Richard must be derived from the
generosity of his character, whatever ferocity his valour may have
possessed. This king, when mortally wounded at the siege of Chaluz,
in the Limousin, by a cross-bowman, not only pardoned him
after the town was taken, but also before his death ordered him to
have a hundred shillings given to him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>
<p>With regard to the true cause of the assassination of Conrad, Marquess
of Montferrat, there is great reason to believe that Humphrey,
Lord of Thoron, the first husband of Isabel, the daughter of Amalric,
and heiress to the kingdom of Jerusalem, seeing his wife, together
with the crown, fall into the possession of Conrad, employed the Assassins
as the ministers of his revenge.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p>“To Leopold, Duke of Austria, the Old Man of the Mountain
sends, greeting:</p>

<p>“Seeing that many kings and princes, beyond sea, accuse the
Lord Richard, King of England, of the death of the marquess, I
swear, by the God who reigns for ever, and by the laws which we
observe, that he had no share in his death: the cause of the marquess’s
death was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One of our brethren journeying in a ship, from Salteleya to our
parts, was driven by a tempest near to Tyre; and the marquess had
him seized and put to death, and laid hands on his money. Now, we
sent our messengers to the marquess, requiring him to restore our
brother’s money, and give us satisfaction for our brother’s death, of
which he accused Reginald, Lord of Sidon; but we ascertained the
truth, by means of our friends, that it was the marquess himself who
caused him to be slain, and his money to be seized.</p>

<p>“And again we sent another messenger to him, by name Eurisus,
whom he would have thrown into the sea, had not our friends caused
him to depart hastily from Tyre: he came quickly to us, and told us
these things. We, therefore, from that hour have desired to slay the
marquess; so, then, we sent two brethren to Tyre, who killed him
openly, and almost before the whole people of Tyre.</p>

<p>“This, therefore, was the cause of the marquess’s death; and we
tell you of a truth, that the Lord Richard, King of England, hath
had no share in this death of the marquess; and they who, on that
account, ill treat the king of England, do it unjustly, and without
cause.</p>

<p>“Know ye for certain, that we slay no man in this world for any
gain or reward, unless he have first injured us.</p>

<p><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Memoir on the Dynasty of the Assassins, and on the Origin of
their Name, by M. Sylvestre de Sacy, read at the public meeting of
the Institute of France, July 7th, 1809.</cite><br /><br /></p>

<p>Among the writers who have transmitted to us the history of
those memorable wars, which, for a space of nearly two centuries,
unceasingly depopulated Europe, in order to carry destruction and desolation
throughout the finest regions of Asia and Africa, there is
scarcely one who does not make mention of that barbarous horde,
which, established in a corner of Syria, and known by the name of
Assassins, rendered itself formidable both to the orientals and occidentals,
and exercised its atrocities indifferently against the Moslem
sultan and the Christian prince. If the historians of the Crusades
have mingled a few fables with the information which they have
handed down to us, regarding the tenets and manners of these sectarians,
we ought not to feel surprised; for the terror which they
inspired, scarcely permitted our warriors to search very deeply into
their origin, or to procure exact data concerning their religious and
political constitution. Even their name has been disfigured and presented
under a multitude of different forms, and it is to this that we
must attribute the uncertainty of modern critics as to its origin and
etymology. Among all the writers who have devoted their attention
to historical and critical researches into the subject of the Assassins,
none has shed more light upon it than M. Falconet. Nevertheless,
as this learned gentleman had not applied himself at all to the study
of the languages of the east, and could not, therefore, avail himself,
in his inquiries, of the assistance of the Persian and Arabian writers,
whose works had never been either published or translated, he has
not been able to trace the Assassins up to their true origin, nor to
give the etymology of their name. It is to supply this defect in his
labours that I have decided upon treating this subject anew. In a
dissertation, which I submitted to the judgment of the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">classe</em>, and of
which I shall present you with a short analysis, I proposed to
inquire, what was the doctrine of this sect, and by what ties they
were related to one of the principal divisions of Mohammedanism;
and, lastly, why they had received a name, which, passing with a
slight change into the west, has furnished several modern languages
with a term expressive of a cool premeditated murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>It is a most singular circumstance, which cannot fail to strike us
in studying the history of the religion and power of the Mohammedans,
that their empire, which, in a small number of years, subjected
the whole of Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Persia, and several other
vast regions of Asia and Africa, was, from the very first, torn by
intestine divisions, which seemed as though they would arrest its
progress, and insure the neighbouring potentates against the invasion
which menaced them. It is difficult to explain how the spirit of
faction, which armed the Musulmans against each other, should not
have checked the rapidity and extent of their conquests; but, without
stopping to consider this point, which forms no part of our subject,
we shall content ourselves with stating the fact, that the death
of Mohammed was the signal of discord amongst those who had embraced
his doctrine, and hitherto fought under his victorious standard.
Ali, Mohammed’s cousin, and husband of his daughter, Fatima, who,
to an ardent zeal for the new religion, added more instruction then
the rest of the Musulmans, seemed destined to supply the place of
the legislator and pontiff of Islamism, and to complete the work left
still imperfect by him. But Mohammed had not had the prudence
to name his successor; or, if he had done so, as Ali’s partisans
generally maintain, he had not given his nomination sufficient publicity
to prevent its being contested; and he had neglected to invest
it with that divine sanction which he so well knew how to give to all
his determinations, even when the interests of his household, and the
altercations excited by his wife’s jealousy, were the only matters in
question. Ali, in consequence, saw the wise Ebubekr, the fierce
Omar, and the weak Othman, preferred before him; and it was only
after the violent death of the latter, that the suffrages of the Musulmans
seemed to unite in his favour. Scarcely had he ascended the
throne, ere an ambitious man, supported by a powerful family, declared
himself his rival; and succeeded, by treachery, and availing
himself of Ali’s faults, in stripping him of an authority, whose legitimacy
was irrefragable. Ali soon fell beneath the murderer’s dagger.
His two sons were not long in experiencing the same fate; and, from
that moment, were laid the immoveable foundations of that schism,
which, to this day, divides the disciples of Mohammed into two great
hostile factions, which, for several centuries, ceased not to steep the
eastern provinces of the empire in blood, and was felt in the most
southern parts of Arabia, and even on the shores of the Atlantic
Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>The partisans of Ali themselves soon split into several parties; and
though united in their veneration for the blood of the prophet, which
flowed in the veins of the descendant of Ali, they neither agreed in
the prerogatives they attached to this noble origin, nor on the branch
to which the right to the dignity of imam was transmitted. This name,
which comprises the idea of all temporal and spiritual power, and which,
in the opinion of some fanatics, was nearly co-equal with that of divinity,
was the watch-word of all the enemies of the khalifs descended from the
houses of Moawia and Abbas; but they did not all recognise the same
person as imam. One of the most powerful, among the factions formed
of the followers of Ali, was that of the Ismailians, so called, because they
maintained that the dignity of imam had been transmitted, through an
uninterrupted succession of descendants, from Ali to a prince named
Ismail; and that, since his time, this same office had been filled by
personages unknown to man, awaiting the moment when the posterity
of Ali should at length triumph over its enemies. A character peculiar
to this sect is, that it explains all the precepts of the Musulman
law allegorically; and this allegory was pushed so far by some of the
Ismailian doctors, that it tended to nothing less than the abolition of
all public worship, and the foundation of a purely philosophical doctrine,
and a very licentious moral code, on the ruins of all revelation
and divine authority. To this sect belong the Karmathites, whose enormities
we shall not here mention, to whom the Wahabees, who, at
this time, fill several of the provinces of the Ottoman empire with the
terror of their name, and who, under the mask of reformers, appear
destined to overthrow the Mohammedan religion, seem to have succeeded.
From this same sect issued the Fatimite khalifs. These,
after establishing themselves in Africa, were not long in depriving
the khalifs of Bagdad, of Egypt and Syria, and they formed a potent
empire, which lasted two centuries and a half, until it was overthrown
by Saladin. These Fatimite khalifs acknowledged themselves to be
Ismailians; but the interests of their policy obliged them to disguise
the secret doctrines of their sect, which were known only to a small
number of adepts, and the most intolerant of them imposed no other
obligation on their subjects, than the recognition of Ali and his descendants’
right to the sovereignty, and to vow a mortal hatred
against the khalifs of Bagdad. In the person of the Fatimites, the
Ismailians had ascended the throne, and deprived the Abbassides of
a considerable portion of their empire: but their ambition was not
satisfied. The race of the prophet ought not to share the sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
with the descendants of usurpers, and even the honour of Islamism,
and of the doctrine taught and propagated by the imams, required
that all Musulmans should be united in the same faith, and pay obedience
to a single legitimate pontiff. To attain this end, missionaries,
spread throughout all the oriental provinces, secretly taught the dogmas
of the Ismailians, and laboured unceasingly to increase the
number of their proselytes, and to inspire them with the spirit of revolt
against the khalifs of Bagdad and the princes who acknowledged
their authority.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixth century of the Hegira, one of
these missionaries, named Hassan, son of Ali, having been gained
over to the Ismailians, afterwards signalized himself by his zeal
in the propagation of his adopted sect. This man, in other respects
a good Musulman, being persuaded that the Fatimite khalif,
Mostanssur, at that time reigning in Egypt, was the legitimate
imam, resolved to repair to his court, deeming himself happy in
being able to proffer his homage, and to revere in him the image and
vice-gerent of the Deity. For this purpose, he left the northern provinces
of Persia, where he was exercising the secret and dangerous
functions of missionary, and proceeded to Egypt. His reputation had
preceded him thither. The reception which he met with from the
khalif, rendered it beyond the reach of doubt, that he would soon be
called to the first offices. As usual, favour excited jealousy, and Hassan’s
enemies soon found an opportunity of rendering him an object
of the khalif’s suspicion. They even wished to have him arrested;
but Mostanssur acceding reluctantly to their plans of revenge, they
were satisfied with putting him on board a vessel bound for the northern
coast of Africa. After some adventures, strongly tinged with the
marvellous, Hassan returned to Syria, and thence passing through
Aleppo, Bagdad, and Ispahan, he traversed the several provinces
submitted to the Seljukide rule, everywhere performing his missionary
functions, and omitting no means to effect the recognition of
Mostanssur’s pontificate. After much travelling about, he at length
established himself in the fortress of Alamut, situated in ancient Parthia,
a short distance from Kaswin. The predictions of Hassan and
some other missionaries, had multiplied the partisans of the Ismailites
in these regions so considerably, that it was far from difficult to him,
to compel the governor of that fortress, commanding in the of
the Sultan Melekshah, to sell it to him for a moderate sum of money.
Having become master of the place, he was able to maintain him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>self
in its possession against all the sultan’s forces; and, by the insinuations
of the missionaries, whom he sent into the environs, and by
planned excursions, he subjected several places in the immediate
neighbourhood, and erected for himself an independent sovereignty;
in which, however, he only exercised his authority in the name of
the imam, whose minister he acknowledged himself to be. The position
of Alamut, situated as it is in the midst of a mountainous region,
caused its prince to receive the title of <em>Sheikh al Jebal</em> (<i>i. e.</i> <em>Sheikh</em>,
or <em>Prince of the Mountains</em>); and the double sense of the word
<em>Sheikh</em>, which means both prince and old man, has occasioned the
historians of the Crusades, and the celebrated Marco Polo, to call him
the “<em>Old Man of the Mountain</em>.”</p>

<p>Hassan and his successors, for nearly three centuries, were not
satisfied with having established their power in Persia: they soon found
means to possess themselves of several strong places in Syria. Masyat,
a place situated in the mountains of the Anti-Libanus, became
their chief seat, in that province; and also the residence of the Prince
of Alamut’s lieutenant. This branch of the Ismailites, which had settled
in Syria, is the one mentioned by the western historians of the
Crusades, and to which they have given the name of <em>Assassin</em>.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the etymology of this name, we ought to observe,
that Hassan, and the two princes who succeeded him in the
sovereignty over the Ismailites of Persia and Syria, although attached
to the peculiar tenets of the sect, nevertheless observed all the laws of
Islamism; but, under the fourth prince of this dynasty, a great change
took place in the religion of the Ismailites. This prince, who was
named Hassan, son of Mohammed, pretended that he had received
secret orders from the imam, by virtue of which he abolished all the
external practices of Musulman worship; permitted his subjects to
drink wine, and gave them a dispensation from all the obligations
which the law of Mohammed imposes on its followers. He publicly
announced, that the knowledge of the allegorical sense of the precepts,
dispenses with the observation of the literal sense; and thus gained
the Ismailites the name of <em>Mulahid</em>, or the <em>Impious</em>; a title by which
they are most frequently designated by oriental writers. The example
of this prince was followed by his son; and, for about fifty years,
the Persian and Syrian Ismailites persisted in this doctrine. After
this period, the worship was restored and preserved among them, until
the entire destruction of their power.</p>

<p>The embassy which the Old Man of the Mountain, of the historians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
of the Crusades, that is, the sovereign of the Ismailites, sent to
Amaury I. King of Jerusalem, falls under the reign of one of the two
apostate princes, whom we have just mentioned. It is true, then, as
William, Archbishop of Tyre, says, that the prince by whom this embassy
was sent, had suppressed all the practices of the Musulman religion,
destroyed the mosques, authorized incestuous unions, and allowed
the use of wine and pork. When we read the sacred book of the Druses,
or the fragments which we possess of those of the Ismailites, we have
little hesitation in believing, that this prince, as the same historian
asserts, was acquainted with the books of the Christians, and that he
had formed a wish not to embrace the Christian religion, but to study
more accurately its doctrines and observances.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the name <em>Assassin</em>. This word, as I have
already said, has been written in a variety of ways; but to confine
myself to those possessing the best authority, I shall state, that it has
been pronounced <em>Assassini</em>, <em>Assissini</em>, and <em>Heississini</em>. Joinville has
written <em>Haussaci</em>. The limits which I have prescribed myself, forbid
my entering here into the discussion of the various etymologies of
this name, which have been proposed by different learned persons.
Suffice it for me to say, that they have all been mistaken, because
they had, no doubt, never met with the word in any Arabic author.
The Assassins are almost always called by oriental historians, <em>Ismailites</em>,
<em>Mulahid</em> (i. e. <em>the Impious</em>), or <em>Batenites</em>, signifying <em>partisans of
the allegorical sense</em>. Only one literary person, in a letter, preserved
by Menage, had a glimpse of the true etymology; but he had erected
it on bad foundations, as he had not the slightest suspicion of the
motive which led to the Ismailites being designated by this term.</p>

<p>One of the most illustrious, most certainly, of the victims to the
fury of the Ismailites, is Saladin. It is true, this great prince escaped
their attacks; but he was twice on the point of losing his life by these
wretches’ daggers, for which he afterwards reaped a striking revenge.
It is in perusing the account of these reiterated attempts, in some
Arabic authors, contemporaries of Saladin, and ocular witnesses of
what they relate, that I have been convinced that the Ismailites, or,
at least, the men whom they employed to execute their horrible projects,
were called, in Arabic, <em>Hashishin</em> in the plural, and <em>Hashishi</em> in
the singular; and this name, slightly altered by the Latin writers,
has been expressed as exactly as possible by several Greek historians,
and by the Jew, Benjamin, of Tudela.</p>

<p>As for the origin of the name in question, although I have not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
gleaned it from any one of the oriental historians that I have consulted,
I have no doubt whatever that denomination was given to the
Ismailites, on account of their using an intoxicating liquid, or preparation,
still known in the east by the name of <em>Hashish</em>. Hemp
leaves, and some other parts of the same vegetable,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> form the basis
of this preparation; which is employed in different ways, either in
liquid, or in the form of pastiles, mixed with saccharine substances;
or even in fumigation. The intoxication produced by the <em>hashish</em>,
causes an ecstasy similar to that which the orientals produce by the
use of opium; and, from the testimony of a great number of travellers,
we may affirm, that those who fall into this state of delirium,
imagine they enjoy the ordinary objects of their desires, and taste
felicity at a cheap rate; but the too frequent enjoyment changes
the animal economy, and produces, first, marasmus, and then, death.
Some, even in this state of temporary insanity, losing all knowledge
of their debility, commit the most brutal actions, so as to disturb the
public peace. It has not been forgotten, that when the French army
was in Egypt, the general-in-chief, Napoleon, was obliged to prohibit,
under the severest penalties, the sale and use of these pernicious
substances; the habit of which has made an imperious want in the
inhabitants of Egypt, particularly the lower orders. Those who indulge
in this custom, are, to this day, called <em>Hashishin</em>; and these
two different expressions explain why the Ismailites were called by
the historians of the Crusades, sometimes <em>Assissini</em>, and sometimes
<em>Assassini</em>.</p>

<p>Let us hasten to meet an objection, which cannot fail to be made
against the motive on which we found the origin of the denomination
of Assassins, as applied to the Ismailites. If the use of intoxicating
substances, prepared from hemp leaves, is able to disturb the reason;
if it throws a man into a sort of delirium, and makes him take dreams
to be realities; how could it be proper for people who had need of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>all their <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</em> and mental calmness, in order to execute the murders
with which they were charged, and who were seen to proceed to
countries most remote from their own residence, to watch many days
for an opportunity favourable to the execution of their designs; to mix
among the soldiers of the prince whom they were about to immolate
to the will of their chieftain; to fight under his colours, and skilfully
to seize the instant which fortune offered for their purpose? This,
certainly, is not the conduct of delirious beings, nor of madmen, carried
away by a fury which they are no longer able to control; such as
travellers describe those who <em>ran a muck</em>, so much dreaded among
the Malays and Indians. One word will suffice, in answer to this
objection; and with this, Marco Polo’s account will supply us. This
traveller, whose veracity is now generally acknowledged, informs us,
that the Old Man of the Mountain educated young men, selected
from the most robust inhabitants of the places under his sway, in order
to make them the executioners of his barbarous decrees. The whole
object of their education went to convince them, that, by blindly
obeying the orders of their chief, they insured to themselves, after
death, the enjoyment of every pleasure that can flatter the senses.
For this purpose, the prince had delightful gardens laid out near his
palace; there, in pavilions, decorated with every thing rich and brilliant
that Asiatic luxury can devise, dwelt young beauties, dedicated
solely to the pleasures of those for whom these enchanting regions
were destined. Thither, from time to time, the princes of the Ismailites
caused the young people, whom they wished to make the blind
instruments of their will, to be transported. After administering to
them a beverage which threw them into a deep sleep, and deprived
them, for some time, of the use of their faculties, they were carried
into those pavilions, which were fully worthy of the gardens of Armida;
on their awaking, every thing which met their eyes, or struck
their ears, threw them into a rapture, which deprived reason of all
control over their minds; and uncertain whether they were still on
earth, or whether they had already entered upon the enjoyment of
that felicity, the picture of which had so often been presented to their
imagination, they yielded in transport to all the kinds of seduction,
by which they were surrounded. After they had passed some days
in these gardens, the same means which had been adopted to introduce
them, without their being conscious of it, were again made use
of to remove them. Advantage was carefully taken of the first moments
of an awakening, which had broken the charm of so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
enjoyment, to make them relate to their young companions, the
wonders of which they had been the witnesses; and they remained
themselves convinced, that the happiness which they had experienced
in the few days which had so soon elapsed, was but the prelude, and,
as it were, the foretaste of that of which they might secure the eternal
possession, by their submission to the orders of their prince.</p>

<p>Although some exaggeration might be supposed to exist in the
Venetian traveller’s recital; and although, instead of crediting the existence
of these enchanted gardens, which is, however, attested by
many other writers, we should still reduce all the wonders of that
magnificent abode to a phantom, produced by the exalted imagination
of the young men who were intoxicated with the <em>hashish</em>, and who,
from their infancy, had been nursed with the idea of this happiness; it
would not be the less true, that we here find the use of a liquor, destined
to deaden the senses, and in which we cannot overlook, that
its employment, or rather abuse, is spread throughout a great part
of Asia and Africa. At the epoch of the Ismailitic power, these
intoxicating preparations were not yet known in the Moslem countries.
It was only at a later period, the knowledge of it was brought
from the most eastern regions, probably even from India into the
Persian provinces. Thence it was communicated to the Musulmans
of Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt. No doubt, the Ismailites,
whose doctrines had several points of resemblance with those
of the Indians, had acquired this knowledge earlier, and preserved it
as a precious secret, and as one of the principal springs of their power.
This conjecture is supported by the fact, that one of the most celebrated
Arabian writers attributes the introduction amongst the Egyptians,
of an electuary prepared from hemp, to a Persian Ismailite.</p>

<p>I shall conclude this memoir by observing, that it is not impossible
that hemp, or some parts of that vegetable, mixed with other substances
unknown to us, may have been sometimes employed to produce
a state of phrenzy and violent madness. We know that opium,
the effects of which are, in general, analogous to those of intoxicating
preparations made with hemp, is, nevertheless, the means made use
of by the Malays, to throw themselves into that state of fury, during
which, being no longer masters of themselves, they murder every one
they meet, and blindly precipitate themselves into the midst of swords
and lances. The means employed thus to alter the effects of opium
is, if travellers are to be believed, mixing it with citron juice, and to
allow the two substances to incorporate for a few days.</p>

<p class="right padr2 f9">
Paris, December, 23, 1809.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were kind enough to insert in your 210th number,
of the 29th of July last, the memoir on the dynasty of the Assassins,
and on the origin of their name; which I read at the public sitting of
the Institute, on the 7th of the same month. That memoir has occasioned
a letter, dated from Marseilles, the 16th of September, 1809,
and signed “M. R., Old Residents in the Levant;” to be likewise
inserted in your 269th number, of the 26th of September.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I am mistaken in suspecting, that the
signature of that letter disguises a justly celebrated name, whose
authority might have added great weight to the objections contained
in the letter, had the writer of it been inclined to make himself known.
However, as the author, or authors, of that letter, in attacking (although
in the most gentlemanly manner, and with the most obliging
expressions) the etymology of the word <em>Assassins</em>, which I have proposed,
display no common knowledge of the Arabic language, I
think it becomes me to justify my opinion, and reply to their objections;
the more so, as the paper which I read at the public sitting of
the 1st of July, was but a very brief extract from a much more extended
memoir; and that this memoir, as well as all the others that I have
submitted to the judgment of the Ancient History and Literature
Class of the Institute, will, perhaps, not be published during my life-time,
owing to the caprice of circumstances, which neither I myself,
nor that class of the Institute, have power to control.</p>

<p>The origin which I attributed to the word <em>Assassin</em>, appears, to
the authors of the letter in question, to be <em>too far fetched</em>; consequently,
they propose another; and affirm, that the name of the
Assassins is nothing more than the plural of <em>Hassas</em>, “a word
which,” they add, “is employed by the people of Syria, and even of
Lower Egypt, to designate <em>a thief of the night&mdash;a robber</em>.”</p>

<p>These gentlemen might have supported their opinion by most respectable
authorities; for their etymology is not new; and I did not
fail to make mention of it, as well as of a host of others, which were,
perhaps, unknown to them, in my memoir, read at the private sitting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
This discussion was not admissible in a reading destined for a public
meeting; I have, therefore, suppressed it entirely. Permit me to
transcribe a few lines here:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Thomas Hyde, I remarked, who had, no doubt, never encountered
the true denomination of the <em>Assassins</em>, in any Arabic
writer, believed, that it must be the Arabic word <em>Hassas</em>, derived
from the root <em>Hassa</em>, which signifies, amongst other things, to <em>kill</em>,
to <em>exterminate</em>. This opinion has been adopted by Menage and the
learned Falconet. M. Volney has likewise admitted it, but without
citing any authority.”</p>

<p>I then discussed the various etymologies proposed by M. de
Caseneuve, the prelate, J. S. Assemani, M. Falconet, the celebrated
Reiske, M. Court de Gebelin, the Abbé S. Assemani, of Padua, and
lastly, Le Moyne; and I showed that none of these writers had given
the true etymology of the name, with the exception of Le Moyne, who
had, indeed, perceived, that the denomination of <em>Assassins</em> or <em>Assissins</em>,
was derived from the Arabic word <em>Haschisch</em> (Hashish). “But,”
I add, “M. Le Moyne did not know why the Ismailites bore the designation
of <em>Haschischin</em> (<em>Hashishin</em>), and he has given a very bad
reason, which has caused the proscription of his etymology.”</p>

<p>Messrs. M. R. assuredly imagine, that it is merely conjecturally
that I have maintained that the Ismailites were designated by the
name of <em>Haschischin</em> (<em>Hashishin</em>), by the Arabs: for they express
themselves thus: “The oldest Italian and French authors commonly
write <em>Assassini</em>, sometimes <em>Heissessini</em>, and <em>Assissini</em>; Joinville
wrote it <em>Haussaci</em>. On these grounds, M. de Sacy <em>doubts not</em>, that
the Arabic which has served as the type, was <em>Haschisch</em> (<em>Hashish</em>),
signifying <em>herb</em>, in general, and in one particular meaning, <em>hemp</em>.
Now, because the Arabs have long known how to prepare a beverage
from hemp, which intoxicates and maddens like opium; and because
this beverage has sometimes been made use of to stimulate fanatics
to the deed, which the Musulmans call <em>the holy war</em>, namely, <em>premeditated
murder</em>, M. de Sacy will have it, that the whole sect of
the Ismailites, which supplied many of this kind of fanatics, was
called <em>Hachichi</em> or <em>Haschischi</em> (<em>Hashishi</em>); that is, the <em>herb people</em>,
but, in order to establish this, it is necessary, in the first place, to prove,
that the use of this beverage was habitual and general among this
sect; so much so, as to distinguish them from all other Arabs, who
used it, but without becoming murderers like them. History teaches
us nothing similar. It even appears, that this artificial means could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
only have been employed when their primitive zeal began to cool;
but, moreover, the word <em>haschisch</em> (<em>hashish</em>), differs too strongly from
the words <em>Assassin</em>, <em>Heissessin</em>, and <em>Haussaci</em>, to have served as their
original root.”</p>

<p>These gentlemen will allow me to observe, that if they had read
with attention my printed Memoir, and the report made by my
esteemed colleague, M. Ginguené, of the labours of the Ancient
History and Literature Class, since the 1st of July, 1808, they
would have found that there was no conjecture in it at all on my
part. In fact, it was in quoting different passages of Arabic authors,
relating to the enterprises undertaken at different periods by the
Syrian Ismailites against Saladin, that I proved to demonstration,
that those writers employed indifferently, in the same work, the names
<em>Ismailites</em>, <em>Batenites</em>, and <em>Haschischin</em> (<em>Hashishin</em>), as synonymous;
and that the chief of this horde of ruffians, was called the Possessor
of the <em>Haschischa</em> (<em>Hashisha</em>). I even took occasion to observe, that
the Byzantine writers called the Assassins <em>Chasisioi</em>; and that the
Jew, Benjamin of Tudela, names them in Hebrew, <em>Haschischin</em>
(<em>Hashishin</em>).</p>

<p>These facts being incontestable, I had to inquire what was this
<em>Haschisch</em> or <em>Haschischa</em> (<em>Hashish</em> or <em>Hashisha</em>), possessed by the
chief of the Ismailites, from which these latter derived their name of
<em>Haschischin</em> (<em>Hashishin</em>); and, certainly, it needed no great stretch
of imagination, to discover the <em>haschiseha</em> of the Ismailites in that
of the Syrians and Egyptians of the present day. I afterwards
showed, by very positive historical testimony, that, at the period
when the Assassins signalized themselves by their atrocities and murders,
the use of intoxicating preparations made with hemp had not
yet been introduced among the Musulmans; lastly, I proved by a
host of facts, and the testimony of Marco Polo, that the <em>hashish</em> was
not used among the Ismailites for the purpose of throwing those to
whom it was administered, into a state of madness and frenzy, during
the continuance of which they performed the most barbarous actions,
almost consciously; but, that it was a secret known only to the chief
of the sect, and which he employed, to deprive for a time of the use of
their reason, those young men, whom he wished, by means of every
kind of seduction, which could inflame the imagination and exalt the
sense, to inspire with blind obedience to his behests.</p>

<p>The chief reason why the authors of the letter which I am controverting,
have a difficulty in admitting that the word <em>Assassins</em>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
<em>Assissins</em>, is actually derived from <em>Haschischin</em>, is, that they cannot
believe that western writers could have substituted the articulation of
the Arabic <em>Sin</em>, that is, of an <em>s</em>, for that of <em>Schin</em> (<em>Shin</em>), which answers
to our <em>ch</em> (<em>sh.</em> Eng.); but they have perhaps forgotten, that,
at the epoch of the Crusades, the Latin language was the common
idiom of writers throughout Europe; and that, in that language, the
sound of the Arabic <em>Shin</em>, cannot be expressed. We must also add,
the Arabic <em>Shin</em> is not in general pronounced so strongly as our <em>ch</em>,
(<em>sh</em>, Eng.); and that the Arabians themselves have often used it for
the Greek sigma, and the Latin <em>S</em>, of Latin names; such as Pontus,
Orosius, Philippus, Busiris, &amp;c., and lastly, that the Moors in Spain,
in writing the Castilian in Arabic characters, made use of the <em>Shin</em> to
express <em>s</em>; for example, in the words <em>los cielos y las tierras</em>. (See
Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits, tome IV. page 631 &amp; 642.) Perhaps,
we have an example of the substitution of our <em>s</em>, for the Arabic
<em>shin</em>, in the word <em>Sarrasins</em> (<em>Saracens</em>).</p>

<p>Here, again, I am at variance with the authors of the letter, who
reject the etymologies which have been hitherto proposed, of the
name of the <em>Sarrasins</em> (<em>Saracens</em>), in order to derive it from <em>Sarrag</em>
or <em>Sarradj</em>, a word, meaning, according to them, a <em>saddle-man</em>, and,
consequently, a <em>horse-man</em>. These gentlemen will not take it ill, if I
deny the consequence, and if I remark, that <em>sarradj</em>, or, as it is otherwise
pronounced, <em>sarrag</em>, never did, and never could, according to the analogy
of the Arabic language, signify any thing but <em>a man who makes
or sells saddles for horses, or a stable-boy who takes care of these
animals’ harness</em>. As I do not wish to be believed on my word
alone, I shall quote Golius, who has not omitted the word <em>Sarrag</em>, as
is asserted in the postscript to the letter, and who translates it thus:
<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui confecit ephippia et ea quæ ad equi et currus apparatum spectans</em>
(one who makes saddles, and every thing belonging to the harness
of horses and carriages). Menins, who translates it into Latin,
by <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ephippiarius</em>, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui Ephippia et quæ ad ea spectant conficit&mdash;qui
curam equorum et apparatus eorum ephippii et phalerarum habet</cite>;
in Italian, by <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">sellaro</cite>, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">palfreniere</cite>; and in French, by <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sellier</em>, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">palfrenier</em>.
Germanus de Silesia, who makes it correspond with the Italian sellaro:
lastly, Father F. Cannes, who, in his Spanish and Arabic Dictionary,
makes use of the Spanish word <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sillero</em>, to translate it. The
objections which Messrs. M. R. make against one of the etymologies
of the word <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sarrasins</em> (Saracens), which several learned men have
derived from the word <em>Sarikin</em>, robbers, are destitute of weight. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
is not true, that we cannot admit this etymology, without, at the same
time, supposing that the Arabs called themselves <em>robbers</em>; because,
in fact, the Arabs known to the Greeks and Latins by the denomination
of <em>Sarrasins</em> (Saracens), did not give themselves that name at
all, but received it from the neighbouring tribes, who may very well
have termed them <em>brigands</em>. This objection has no more force against
those who derive the name of <em>Sarrasins</em>, <em>Saracens</em>, <em>Saraceni</em>, from
<em>sharki</em>, or <em>sharaki</em>, that is, <em>eastern</em>. If this latter be the true origin
of the name, it is beyond a doubt that it was first given to some
Arabs, by nations inhabiting a more western country, and that it
might afterwards have been applied to the greater part of the nation.
As, according to either hypothesis, the word <em>Sarrasins</em> (<em>Saracens</em>), will
have an Arabian origin, there will be some probability in supposing,
that this denomination, which succeeded that of the <em>Scenites</em>, was
first given to the Nomade Arabs by the civilized tribes settled in
the north-east of Arabia, and who recognised the Roman authority.
In either case, if these etymologies appear too forced, I should
prefer confessing, that we are ignorant of the origin of the word, than
deriving it from an expression which is in no respect proper to
characterize the Arabian nation.</p>

<p>I shall conclude, by observing, as I did in my Memoir, that, perhaps,
the word <em>Hashishin</em>, or <em>Hashashin</em>, for both are used, did not
properly designate all the Ismailites, but was peculiarly applied to
those who were destined to the Assassin service, and who were also
known by the name of Fedawi (or <em>devoted</em>). “I have not, up to this
day,” I said, at the conclusion of my Memoir, “met with a sufficient
number of passages in which this word is employed, to hazard a
decided opinion on the subject; but I am led to believe, that among
the Ismailites, those only were termed <em>Hashishin</em>, who were specially
educated to commit murder, and who were, by the use of the <em>Hashish</em>,
disposed to an absolute resignation to the will of their chief; this,
however, may not have prevented the denomination from being applied
to Ismailites collectively, especially among the Occidentals.”</p>

<p>“In India, hemp is cultivated as a luxury, and used solely as an excitant.
It possesses several peculiar intoxicating powers, and produces luxurious dreams
and trances. The leaves are sometimes chewed, and sometimes smoked as
tobacco. A stupifying liquor is also prepared from them; and they enter with
opium, betel nut, sugar, &amp;c. into various narcotic preparations. Prepared hemp
is called by the Arabs <em>hashish</em>, &amp;c. &amp;c.”&mdash;Burnett’s Botany, p. 560.</p></div>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
